       "  'text': 'First, let’s walk through a brief history of job titles. I decided to start with this section to dispel some myths about the “data scientist” job title and shed some light on why there are so many ML-related job titles. After understanding this history, you should be more aware of what job titles to aim for yourself. If you’ve ever been confused about the litany of titles such as machine learning engineer (MLE), product data sci‐ entist, MLOps engineer, and more, this section is for you. ML techniques aren’t a new thing; in 1985, David Ackley, Geoffrey E. Hinton, and Terrence J. Sejnowski popularized the Boltzmann Machine algorithm. 3 Even before that, regression techniques 4 had early developments in the 1800s. There have long been jobs and roles that use modeling techniques to forecast and predict. Econome‐ tricians, statisticians, financial modelers, physics modelers, and biochemical modelers have existed as professions for decades. The main difference is that there were much smaller datasets compared to the modern day (barring simulations). It was only in recent years, just before the 21st century, when compute power started to increase exponentially. In addition, advances in distributed and parallel computing created a cycle in which “big data” became more readily available. This allowed practitioners to apply that advanced compute power to millions or billions of data points. Larger datasets started being accumulated and distributed for ML research, such as WordNet, 5 and, subsequently, ImageNet, 6 a project led by Fei-Fei Li. These collective efforts laid the foundation for even more ML breakthroughs. AlexNet 7 was released in 2012, achieving high accuracy in the ImageNet challenge, 8 which demonstrated that deep learning can be adept at humanlike tasks at a scale that had not been seen before. Many ML practitioners see this as a time when machine learning, deep learning, and related topics increased by leaps and bounds in terms of recognition from the broader population, not just the AI community. The recent popularity of generative AI (such as ChatGPT) in 2022 and 2023 didn’t come out of nowhere, nor did the deepfakes, self-driving cars, chess bots, and more that came before it; these applica‐ tions were the results of many advances over recent years. “Data scientist” as a job title began as an umbrella term, when the ML and data fields were less mature. The term “data scientist” on Google Trends , which measures the popularity of search terms, surged in 2012. That was the year when that article was published by Harvard Business Review: “Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century.” 9 By April 2013, the search popularity of “data scientist” was already tied with “statistician” and subsequently surpassed it by magnitudes, as shown in Figure 1-2 . Back in those days, there wasn’t a narrow divide between infrastructure jobs and model training, though. For example, Kubernetes was first released in 2014, but companies have taken some time to adopt it for orchestrating ML jobs. So now there are more specific job titles for ML infrastructure that didn’t exist before. Figure 1-2. Search popularity for the terms “data scientist,” “machine learning engi‐ neer,” and “statistician” on Google Trends (retrieved August 9, 2023). As social media, web recommender systems, and other modern use cases increased, companies started gathering much more granular data, such as clickstream data , which is data collected as a user browses a website or app. Another recent advance‐ ment is an average corporation being able to store the sheer amount of telemetry from machines and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Previously, data scientists may have worked with data that was updated weekly or daily. Now, as many applications update more frequently or in real time, more infrastructure is needed to serve ML functionality in web products and apps, so more jobs have been created around those functions as well. In short: as the machine learning lifecycle grew more complex, more job titles were created to describe the new skills that a full ML team now requires. I’ll elaborate more on the job titles and ML lifecycle later in this chapter. All of this happened within the last decade, and companies don’t always change their job titles to reflect how the roles have become more specialized. Regardless, as a can‐ didate, knowing this history can help reduce confusion and frustration from applying for a job and finding the role is different from another company’s job with the exact same title. See Table 1-1 for previous trends in ML-related job titles and Table 1-2 for current trends in ML job titles. Table 1-1. Previous trends of ML and data job titles Table 1-2. Current trends of ML and data job titles With that history to explain why you will encounter different job titles, I’ll elaborate on each of these job titles and their responsibilities.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'To set the stage for the rest of the book, I’ll go over what I call the three pillars of ML and data science roles: • Machine learning algorithms and data intuition • Programming and software engineering skills • Execution and communication skills These are the broad categories of skills that you will be evaluated on during ML job interviews. This book focuses a lot on helping you understand these skills and bridge any gaps between your current experiences and skills and those under these three pillars (see Figure 1-6 ). All these skills will be expanded on in the following chapters. Figure 1-6. Three pillars of machine learning jobs. You’re able to understand the underlying workings of ML algorithms and statistics theory and their respective trade-offs—which is essential when you’re faced with an open-ended question in a real-world ML project at work. You’re not just following steps as you would for a school assignment. Having data intuition means that when you’re faced with a new problem, you know how to use data to solve it; and when you encounter new data or data sources, you know how to dive in to evaluate them. You ask yourself, is this data suitable for ML? What types of ML models might it be suitable for? Are there any issues with the data before you can use it for ML? You know what to ask and how to find the answers. In the ML job-interview process, various types of interviews and interview questions are aimed at assessing a candidate’s knowledge and readiness in this pillar, which I’ll cover in Chapters 3 and 4 . While working on a project, you have the programming skills required to deliver, such as manipulating data with Python or using an internal deploy process so that another team can use the results from the ML model. Even if you know the theory well, without the programming or software engineer‐ ing 14 sense, you can’t make ML materialize out of thin air. You need to use code to connect the data with ML algorithms, which are also implemented with code—that is, you must convert theory to practice. Other programming skills in high demand for ML roles are the (software) engineer’s ability to transition from prototype to production—that is, the ML is integrated and released. Some roles are responsible for end-to-end ML: from researching and train‐ ing models to deployment and production. Some ML roles, such as MLOps engi‐ neers, are responsible for building software infrastructure that can handle the demands of processing large amounts of data to send ML responses to users in sec‐ onds or even milliseconds. In the ML job-interview process, various types of interviews and interview questions assess a candidate’s skills in this pillar, which I’ll walk through in Chapters 5 and 6 . You’re able to work with people who aren’t in the same role as you. In ML, we work with software engineers, data engineers, product managers, and many other collea‐ gues. The ability to get things done in a team encompasses a few soft skills such as communication and some project management skills. For example, being unable to communicate with team members is a real blocker 15 for projects and could cause your ML projects to languish or even be deprioritized. Even in cases where you work with only one person (say, your boss), you still need to be able to report on your projects, which requires communication skills. Consequently, in the ML field a highly in-demand skill is being able to communicate technical con‐ cepts with nontechnical stakeholders. You’ll also need some project management skills to keep your tasks on track. We all learn to how manage our to-do lists and calendars during the process of education or self-learning, but it’s more chaotic since now your project calendar depends on oth‐ ers’ calendars and priorities. Even if you have a project and/or product manager to keep the team on track, you still need to manage yourself to some extent. Without soft skills, things don’t get done, full stop. Don’t be that candidate who focu‐ ses only on technical skills but neglects building and demonstrating their soft skills in interviews. I’ll delve into the details of how ML interviews evaluate candidates on this pillar in Chapter 7 . Growing your skills in all three ML pillars is a tall order, and for entry-level roles you’re usually only expected to have a minimum (such as a 3/10) for each pillar, as illustrated in Figure 1-7 . For example, a job candidate who has some exposure to pro‐ gramming, even if they aren’t skilled or experienced, can be taught to improve. Ideally, you’d be stronger on at least one pillar (such as 5/10 for programming) that is most related to the particular ML role in order to stand out from other job candidates. Figure 1-7. Minimum required skill levels for ML jobs (example). For senior roles, the bare minimum requirements are higher, but a similar rule of thumb applies: clear the minimum skill requirements. From then on, you’ll be com‐ pared with other candidates on the skills that you are great in, depending on the role. Data scientists who only train ML models but don’t deploy them might not need to develop their programming skills as much as their ML theory and communication skills. For entry level roles, I’d argue that the communication pillar has a lower requirement (but not 0/10, please!) because it takes the hard-earned experience of working with a larger group of people, including nontechnical teammates, to raise it higher. This also gives some candidates an edge in this pillar: for those with a nontraditional back‐ ground, such as candidates who are self-taught or switching from software engineer roles or another field, the ability to adeptly tell a story and showcase a portfolio can set them apart from other candidates. Now that you’ve had an overview of the three pillars, you can use this mental model to stand out.'}]"

      "Section: A Brief History of Machine Learning and Data Science Job Titles\n",
      "Text: First, let’s walk through a brief history of job titles. I decided to start with this section to dispel some myths about the “data scientist” job title and shed some light on why there are so many ML-related job titles. After understanding this history, you should be more aware of what job titles to aim for yourself. If you’ve ever been confused about the litany of titles such as machine learning engineer (MLE), product data sci‐ entist, MLOps engineer, and more, this section is for you. ML techniques aren’t a new thing; in 1985, David Ackley, Geoffrey E. Hinton, and Terrence J. Sejnowski popularized the Boltzmann Machine algorithm. 3 Even before that, regression techniques 4 had early developments in the 1800s. There have long been jobs and roles that use modeling techniques to forecast and predict. Econome‐ tricians, statisticians, financial modelers, physics modelers, and biochemical modelers have existed as professions for decades. The main difference is that there were much smaller datasets compared to the modern day (barring simulations). It was only in recent years, just before the 21st century, when compute power started to increase exponentially. In addition, advances in distributed and parallel computing created a cycle in which “big data” became more readily available. This allowed practitioners to apply that advanced compute power to millions or billions of data points. Larger datasets started being accumulated and distributed for ML research, such as WordNet, 5 and, subsequently, ImageNet, 6 a project led by Fei-Fei Li. These collective efforts laid the foundation for even more ML breakthroughs. AlexNet 7 was released in 2012, achieving high accuracy in the ImageNet challenge, 8 which demonstrated that deep learning can be adept at humanlike tasks at a scale that had not been seen before. Many ML practitioners see this as a time when machine learning, deep learning, and related topics increased by leaps and bounds in terms of recognition from the broader population, not just the AI community. The recent popularity of generative AI (such as ChatGPT) in 2022 and 2023 didn’t come out of nowhere, nor did the deepfakes, self-driving cars, chess bots, and more that came before it; these applica‐ tions were the results of many advances over recent years. “Data scientist” as a job title began as an umbrella term, when the ML and data fields were less mature. The term “data scientist” on Google Trends , which measures the popularity of search terms, surged in 2012. That was the year when that article was published by Harvard Business Review: “Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century.” 9 By April 2013, the search popularity of “data scientist” was already tied with “statistician” and subsequently surpassed it by magnitudes, as shown in Figure 1-2 . Back in those days, there wasn’t a narrow divide between infrastructure jobs and model training, though. For example, Kubernetes was first released in 2014, but companies have taken some time to adopt it for orchestrating ML jobs. So now there are more specific job titles for ML infrastructure that didn’t exist before. Figure 1-2. Search popularity for the terms “data scientist,” “machine learning engi‐ neer,” and “statistician” on Google Trends (retrieved August 9, 2023). As social media, web recommender systems, and other modern use cases increased, companies started gathering much more granular data, such as clickstream data , which is data collected as a user browses a website or app. Another recent advance‐ ment is an average corporation being able to store the sheer amount of telemetry from machines and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Previously, data scientists may have worked with data that was updated weekly or daily. Now, as many applications update more frequently or in real time, more infrastructure is needed to serve ML functionality in web products and apps, so more jobs have been created around those functions as well. In short: as the machine learning lifecycle grew more complex, more job titles were created to describe the new skills that a full ML team now requires. I’ll elaborate more on the job titles and ML lifecycle later in this chapter. All of this happened within the last decade, and companies don’t always change their job titles to reflect how the roles have become more specialized. Regardless, as a can‐ didate, knowing this history can help reduce confusion and frustration from applying for a job and finding the role is different from another company’s job with the exact same title. See Table 1-1 for previous trends in ML-related job titles and Table 1-2 for current trends in ML job titles. Table 1-1. Previous trends of ML and data job titles Table 1-2. Current trends of ML and data job titles With that history to explain why you will encounter different job titles, I’ll elaborate on each of these job titles and their responsibilities.\n",

      "Title: Machine Learning Roles and the Interview Process\n",
      "Section: The Three Pillars of Machine Learning Roles\n",
      "Text: To set the stage for the rest of the book, I’ll go over what I call the three pillars of ML and data science roles: • Machine learning algorithms and data intuition • Programming and software engineering skills • Execution and communication skills These are the broad categories of skills that you will be evaluated on during ML job interviews. This book focuses a lot on helping you understand these skills and bridge any gaps between your current experiences and skills and those under these three pillars (see Figure 1-6 ). All these skills will be expanded on in the following chapters. Figure 1-6. Three pillars of machine learning jobs. You’re able to understand the underlying workings of ML algorithms and statistics theory and their respective trade-offs—which is essential when you’re faced with an open-ended question in a real-world ML project at work. You’re not just following steps as you would for a school assignment. Having data intuition means that when you’re faced with a new problem, you know how to use data to solve it; and when you encounter new data or data sources, you know how to dive in to evaluate them. You ask yourself, is this data suitable for ML? What types of ML models might it be suitable for? Are there any issues with the data before you can use it for ML? You know what to ask and how to find the answers. In the ML job-interview process, various types of interviews and interview questions are aimed at assessing a candidate’s knowledge and readiness in this pillar, which I’ll cover in Chapters 3 and 4 . While working on a project, you have the programming skills required to deliver, such as manipulating data with Python or using an internal deploy process so that another team can use the results from the ML model. Even if you know the theory well, without the programming or software engineer‐ ing 14 sense, you can’t make ML materialize out of thin air. You need to use code to connect the data with ML algorithms, which are also implemented with code—that is, you must convert theory to practice. Other programming skills in high demand for ML roles are the (software) engineer’s ability to transition from prototype to production—that is, the ML is integrated and released. Some roles are responsible for end-to-end ML: from researching and train‐ ing models to deployment and production. Some ML roles, such as MLOps engi‐ neers, are responsible for building software infrastructure that can handle the demands of processing large amounts of data to send ML responses to users in sec‐ onds or even milliseconds. In the ML job-interview process, various types of interviews and interview questions assess a candidate’s skills in this pillar, which I’ll walk through in Chapters 5 and 6 . You’re able to work with people who aren’t in the same role as you. In ML, we work with software engineers, data engineers, product managers, and many other collea‐ gues. The ability to get things done in a team encompasses a few soft skills such as communication and some project management skills. For example, being unable to communicate with team members is a real blocker 15 for projects and could cause your ML projects to languish or even be deprioritized. Even in cases where you work with only one person (say, your boss), you still need to be able to report on your projects, which requires communication skills. Consequently, in the ML field a highly in-demand skill is being able to communicate technical con‐ cepts with nontechnical stakeholders. You’ll also need some project management skills to keep your tasks on track. We all learn to how manage our to-do lists and calendars during the process of education or self-learning, but it’s more chaotic since now your project calendar depends on oth‐ ers’ calendars and priorities. Even if you have a project and/or product manager to keep the team on track, you still need to manage yourself to some extent. Without soft skills, things don’t get done, full stop. Don’t be that candidate who focu‐ ses only on technical skills but neglects building and demonstrating their soft skills in interviews. I’ll delve into the details of how ML interviews evaluate candidates on this pillar in Chapter 7 . Growing your skills in all three ML pillars is a tall order, and for entry-level roles you’re usually only expected to have a minimum (such as a 3/10) for each pillar, as illustrated in Figure 1-7 . For example, a job candidate who has some exposure to pro‐ gramming, even if they aren’t skilled or experienced, can be taught to improve. Ideally, you’d be stronger on at least one pillar (such as 5/10 for programming) that is most related to the particular ML role in order to stand out from other job candidates. Figure 1-7. Minimum required skill levels for ML jobs (example). For senior roles, the bare minimum requirements are higher, but a similar rule of thumb applies: clear the minimum skill requirements. From then on, you’ll be com‐ pared with other candidates on the skills that you are great in, depending on the role. Data scientists who only train ML models but don’t deploy them might not need to develop their programming skills as much as their ML theory and communication skills. For entry level roles, I’d argue that the communication pillar has a lower requirement (but not 0/10, please!) because it takes the hard-earned experience of working with a larger group of people, including nontechnical teammates, to raise it higher. This also gives some candidates an edge in this pillar: for those with a nontraditional back‐ ground, such as candidates who are self-taught or switching from software engineer roles or another field, the ability to adeptly tell a story and showcase a portfolio can set them apart from other candidates. Now that you’ve had an overview of the three pillars, you can use this mental model to stand out.\n"
