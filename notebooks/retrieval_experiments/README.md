 # Experimentation with different retrieval methods


 This folder contains notebooks where you can find the analysis of different retrieval methods applied to the project but before that let's briefly explain some concepts.

 ## What is a retrieval?

 Retrieval, or information retrieval, is the process of searching for and retrieving relevant data from a large set of information. In the context of data science it usually refers to finding specific documents, passages, or data points that answer a given query.

 ## How Does Retrieval Work?

The basic retrieval process involves:

1. User Query: A user poses a question or search expression.
2. Index: The retrieval system has previously indexed a set of documents or data, allowing for fast searching.
3. Search and Matching: The system compares the query to the index and finds the most relevant documents based on certain criteria.
4. Ranking: Retrieved documents are ranked by relevance using a specific metric or algorithm.
5. Results: The most relevant documents or pieces of information are presented to the user.
