       "    'text': 'In the first part of this chapter, I’ll walk through the structure of this book. Then, I’ll discuss the various job titles and roles that use ML skills in industry. 1 I’ll also clarify the responsibilities of various job titles, such as data scientist, machine learning engineer, and so on, as this is a common point of confusion for job seekers. These will be illustrated with an ML skills matrix and ML lifecycle that will be referenced throughout the book. The second part of this chapter walks through the interview process, from beginning to end. I’ve mentored candidates who appreciated this overview since online resources often focus on specific pieces of the interview but not how they all connect together and result in an offer. Especially for new graduates 2 and readers coming from different industries, this chapter helps get everyone on the same page as well as clarifies the process. The interconnecting pieces of interviews are complex, with many types of combina‐ tions depending on the ML role you’re aiming for. This overview will help set the stage, so you’ll know what to focus your time on. For example, some online resources focus on knowledge specific to “product data scientists,” but will title the course or article “data scientist interview tips” without differentiating. For a newcomer, it’s hard to tell if that is relevant to your own career interests. After this chapter, you’ll be able to tell what skills are required for each job title, and in Chapter 2 , you’ll be able to parse out that information yourself from job postings and make your resume as relevant to the job title and job posting as possible. This chapter focuses on helping you differentiate among various ML roles, and walks through the entire interview process, as illustrated in Figure 1-1 : • Job applications and resume ( Chapter 2 ) • Technical interviews — Machine learning (Chapters 3 , 4 , and 6 ) — Coding/programming ( Chapter 5 ) • Behavioral interviews ( Chapter 7 ) • Your interview roadmap ( Chapter 8 ) • Post-interview and follow-up ( Chapter 9 ) Figure 1-1. Overview of the chapters and how they tie into the ML interview process. Depending on where you are in your ML interview journey, I encourage you to focus on the chapters and sections that seem relevant to you. I’ve also planned the book to be referenced as you go along; for example, you might iterate on your resume multi‐ ple times and then flip back to Chapter 2 when needed. The same applies to the other chapters. With that overview, let’s continue. The companion site to this book, https://susanshu.substack.com , features bonus content, helper resources, and more.'},\n",
       "   {'section': 'A Brief History of Machine Learning and Data Science Job Titles',\n",
       "    'text': 'First, let’s walk through a brief history of job titles. I decided to start with this section to dispel some myths about the “data scientist” job title and shed some light on why there are so many ML-related job titles. After understanding this history, you should be more aware of what job titles to aim for yourself. If you’ve ever been confused about the litany of titles such as machine learning engineer (MLE), product data sci‐ entist, MLOps engineer, and more, this section is for you. ML techniques aren’t a new thing; in 1985, David Ackley, Geoffrey E. Hinton, and Terrence J. Sejnowski popularized the Boltzmann Machine algorithm. 3 Even before that, regression techniques 4 had early developments in the 1800s. There have long been jobs and roles that use modeling techniques to forecast and predict. Econome‐ tricians, statisticians, financial modelers, physics modelers, and biochemical modelers have existed as professions for decades. The main difference is that there were much smaller datasets compared to the modern day (barring simulations). It was only in recent years, just before the 21st century, when compute power started to increase exponentially. In addition, advances in distributed and parallel computing created a cycle in which “big data” became more readily available. This allowed practitioners to apply that advanced compute power to millions or billions of data points. Larger datasets started being accumulated and distributed for ML research, such as WordNet, 5 and, subsequently, ImageNet, 6 a project led by Fei-Fei Li. These collective efforts laid the foundation for even more ML breakthroughs. AlexNet 7 was released in 2012, achieving high accuracy in the ImageNet challenge, 8 which demonstrated that deep learning can be adept at humanlike tasks at a scale that had not been seen before. Many ML practitioners see this as a time when machine learning, deep learning, and related topics increased by leaps and bounds in terms of recognition from the broader population, not just the AI community. The recent popularity of generative AI (such as ChatGPT) in 2022 and 2023 didn’t come out of nowhere, nor did the deepfakes, self-driving cars, chess bots, and more that came before it; these applica‐ tions were the results of many advances over recent years. “Data scientist” as a job title began as an umbrella term, when the ML and data fields were less mature. The term “data scientist” on Google Trends , which measures the popularity of search terms, surged in 2012. That was the year when that article was published by Harvard Business Review: “Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century.” 9 By April 2013, the search popularity of “data scientist” was already tied with “statistician” and subsequently surpassed it by magnitudes, as shown in Figure 1-2 . Back in those days, there wasn’t a narrow divide between infrastructure jobs and model training, though. For example, Kubernetes was first released in 2014, but companies have taken some time to adopt it for orchestrating ML jobs. So now there are more specific job titles for ML infrastructure that didn’t exist before. Figure 1-2. Search popularity for the terms “data scientist,” “machine learning engi‐ neer,” and “statistician” on Google Trends (retrieved August 9, 2023). As social media, web recommender systems, and other modern use cases increased, companies started gathering much more granular data, such as clickstream data , which is data collected as a user browses a website or app. Another recent advance‐ ment is an average corporation being able to store the sheer amount of telemetry from machines and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Previously, data scientists may have worked with data that was updated weekly or daily. Now, as many applications update more frequently or in real time, more infrastructure is needed to serve ML functionality in web products and apps, so more jobs have been created around those functions as well. In short: as the machine learning lifecycle grew more complex, more job titles were created to describe the new skills that a full ML team now requires. I’ll elaborate more on the job titles and ML lifecycle later in this chapter. All of this happened within the last decade, and companies don’t always change their job titles to reflect how the roles have become more specialized. Regardless, as a can‐ didate, knowing this history can help reduce confusion and frustration from applying for a job and finding the role is different from another company’s job with the exact same title. See Table 1-1 for previous trends in ML-related job titles and Table 1-2 for current trends in ML job titles. Table 1-1. Previous trends of ML and data job titles Table 1-2. Current trends of ML and data job titles With that history to explain why you will encounter different job titles, I’ll elaborate on each of these job titles and their responsibilities.'},\n",

       "    'text': 'Here is a nonexhaustive list of job titles for ML (or closely related) roles: • Data scientist • Machine learning engineer • Applied scientist • Software engineer, machine learning • MLOps engineer • Product data scientist • Data analyst • Decision scientist • Research scientist As I discussed “A Brief History of Machine Learning and Data Science Job Titles” on page 3 , each role is responsible for a different part of the ML lifecycle. A job title alone does not convey what the job entails. As a job seeker, be warned: in different companies, completely different titles might end up doing similar jobs! As illustrated in Figure 1-3 , your ML job title will depend on the company, the team, and which part(s) of the ML lifecycle your role is responsible for. To give specific examples of how job titles can depend on the company or organiza‐ tion that is hiring for the job—based on real people I’ve spoken to, job descriptions, and job interviews—the person responsible for training ML models but not for build‐ ing the underlying platform might be called the following: • Software engineer (ML) or data scientist (Google) • Applied scientist (Amazon) • Machine learning engineer (Meta, Pinterest) • Data scientist (Elastic, the team where I work) • Data scientist (Unity) Figure 1-3. What’s in a machine learning job title? By the time this book is published, any of the job titles within these companies and teams may have changed. Regardless, it demon‐ strates the point that ML titles may vary between companies and even between different teams in the same company. The job title also depends on the organization, the department, and so on. Some departments in Google have the data scientist 12 job title, and some don’t. At the com‐ panies where I’ve worked, my teams had data scientists train ML models while MLEs built the infrastructure (working all day in tools such as Kubernetes, Terraform, Jen‐ kins, and so on). In some other companies, MLEs are the ones who train ML models. As a personal example, my work experience has heavily involved ML model training, so I apply for jobs that have the title “machine learning engineer” or “data scientist.” I’ll provide more examples of skills and roles that could be a good fit for your inter‐ ests and skills in the following sections. As mentioned in the Preface , this book focuses more on the industry applications of ML rather than research roles. Here’s a brief overview of research roles: Requirements Most often PhD. Responsibilities Similar to academic roles/academia, such as conducting research and coming up with novel algorithms and improvements, authoring papers, presenting at aca‐ demic conferences, and so on. If you’re in a research role in industry , such as a researcher at Google DeepMind, the main difference is that there isn’t a require‐ ment for teaching (that I know of).'},\n",
       "   {'section': 'Machine Learning Lifecycle',\n",
       "    'text': 'In industry, it is an expectation for applied ML projects to eventually improve the customer experience—for example, a better recommender system that shows the user more relevant videos, news, and social media posts. In industry, “customer” can also mean internal customers: people within the same company or organization. For example, your team builds ML models that predict demand, which helps your com‐ pany’s logistics department better plan its shipment schedules. Regardless of whether the user is external or internal, many components are involved in building a full the user is external or internal, many components are involved in building a fullfledged, end-to-end ML product. I’ll walk through a simplified example. First, there needs to be data, as most ML is trained and tested with large amounts of data. Someone needs to make sure the raw data is brought in (ingested) so that it’s easily accessible later on for data analysis, ML, reporting and monitoring, and so on. This is illustrated by step A (data) in Figure 1-4 . Next, with the data in place, someone with knowledge of ML algorithms and tools will use the data to start ML development. This is illustrated by step B (machine learning development) in Figure 1-4 . This involves feature engineering, model train‐ ing, and evaluation. If the results aren’t great, there is a lot of iteration in step B, and this person might enhance their feature engineering or model training, or even go back to step A and request that more data be ingested. Once there are somewhat satisfactory results, they’ll move on to step C (machine learning deployment), which connects the ML models to customers. Depending on the type of ML project, it could be deployed to a website, app, internal dashboard, and so on. Of course, they’d like to make sure the ML is working properly, so any good team will have a way to monitor the results. In ML there are two main types of potential issues. The first is that something in the software layer doesn’t work, such as bugs in the code. The second is a data or ML model issue—for example, in the model-development phase, the model outputs normal results, but after deployment/ release, there is data imbalance, so then the model results become undesirable. From step C onward, there can be more iteration back to step B to improve the models and run more experiments in step C again. Figure 1-4. Machine learning lifecycle (the graph is simplified for understanding). In the machine learning lifecycle I just walked through, a lot of skills are required. Data pipelines, model training, maintaining continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD): as a job candidate, what should you be learning to prepare for the interview? Thankfully, as I mentioned in “A Brief History of Machine Learning and Data Science Job Titles” on page 3 companies nowadays might hire people who have a subset of these skills. For example, they need some people specialized in step A (data engineering), some specialized in step B (ML development), some in step C (ML deployment), and so forth. I emphasize the might since it still differs depending on the company or team; I will walk through some scenarios. Startup roles will usually wear more hats, meaning they will need to do the jobs in multiple steps in the machine learning lifecycle as illustrated in Figure 1-4 . Here’s an example: Usually, startup companies have the goal of shipping 13 an end-to-end product, but because they have fewer customers they might care less about the scale and stability (at an early stage). Hence, it’s more likely that the person developing and training ML models is the same person doing data analysis and presenting to stakeholders, or even the same person building the platform infrastructure. An ML team in a startup might simply have fewer people. For example, the startup might have 30 software engineers and data people in total, whereas larger corporations could have a team of data ana‐ lysts alone numbering 30 people to disperse the workload. If the company and/or team has grown enough, it is more likely the ML roles have become more specialized. Generally, the larger the team, the more specialized the role. If the “machine learning engineer” at a larger company trains models, then it’s likely they don’t wear two or three hats at once, as they might at a startup. Instead, the big company hires more people to fill those roles. That isn’t to say the work is simpler at a larger company. In fact, there’s often more data, more scale, and more downsides if the ML functionality goes down, so each MLE’s time could be com‐ pletely tied up wearing only one hat. Larger company size often corresponds to larger ML teams, but it depends. For example, a large company in a traditionally nontech industry, might have its first ML team hires operate in more of a startup-like environment while they figure out how ML best works for the company. Let’s go one level deeper and add more details of ML or data responsibilities. Figure 1-5 expands on the machine learning lifecycle from Figure 1-4 to reflect teams or companies with more fine-grained roles. (It’s worth repeating that even if this list is a useful and common enough heuristic, it’s still a bit simplified for illustration pur‐ poses since there will always be exceptions and outliers.) Figure 1-5. Machine learning lifecycle with more fine-grained roles (extended version of Figure 1-4 ). Here’s an example of what your role might be responsible for within these more fine Here’s an example of what your role might be responsible for within these more finegrained roles, as illustrated in Figure 1-5 : • You build the data pipelines for analytics and ML (step A). • You train ML models (step B). • You build the infrastructure for ML models to be deployed (step C.1). • You design and conduct hypothesis testing, often A/B tests, for new ML product features (step C.2). • You do data analysis, build reports and dashboards, and present to stakeholders (step D).

       "   {'section': 'The Three Pillars of Machine Learning Roles',\n",
       "    'text': 'To set the stage for the rest of the book, I’ll go over what I call the three pillars of ML and data science roles: • Machine learning algorithms and data intuition • Programming and software engineering skills • Execution and communication skills These are the broad categories of skills that you will be evaluated on during ML job interviews. This book focuses a lot on helping you understand these skills and bridge any gaps between your current experiences and skills and those under these three pillars (see Figure 1-6 ). All these skills will be expanded on in the following chapters. Figure 1-6. Three pillars of machine learning jobs. You’re able to understand the underlying workings of ML algorithms and statistics theory and their respective trade-offs—which is essential when you’re faced with an open-ended question in a real-world ML project at work. You’re not just following steps as you would for a school assignment. Having data intuition means that when you’re faced with a new problem, you know how to use data to solve it; and when you encounter new data or data sources, you know how to dive in to evaluate them. You ask yourself, is this data suitable for ML? What types of ML models might it be suitable for? Are there any issues with the data before you can use it for ML? You know what to ask and how to find the answers. In the ML job-interview process, various types of interviews and interview questions are aimed at assessing a candidate’s knowledge and readiness in this pillar, which I’ll cover in Chapters 3 and 4 . While working on a project, you have the programming skills required to deliver, such as manipulating data with Python or using an internal deploy process so that another team can use the results from the ML model. Even if you know the theory well, without the programming or software engineer‐ ing 14 sense, you can’t make ML materialize out of thin air. You need to use code to connect the data with ML algorithms, which are also implemented with code—that is, you must convert theory to practice. Other programming skills in high demand for ML roles are the (software) engineer’s ability to transition from prototype to production—that is, the ML is integrated and released. Some roles are responsible for end-to-end ML: from researching and train‐ ing models to deployment and production. Some ML roles, such as MLOps engi‐ neers, are responsible for building software infrastructure that can handle the demands of processing large amounts of data to send ML responses to users in sec‐ onds or even milliseconds. In the ML job-interview process, various types of interviews and interview questions assess a candidate’s skills in this pillar, which I’ll walk through in Chapters 5 and 6 . You’re able to work with people who aren’t in the same role as you. In ML, we work with software engineers, data engineers, product managers, and many other collea‐ gues. The ability to get things done in a team encompasses a few soft skills such as communication and some project management skills. For example, being unable to communicate with team members is a real blocker 15 for projects and could cause your ML projects to languish or even be deprioritized. Even in cases where you work with only one person (say, your boss), you still need to be able to report on your projects, which requires communication skills. Consequently, in the ML field a highly in-demand skill is being able to communicate technical con‐ cepts with nontechnical stakeholders. You’ll also need some project management skills to keep your tasks on track. We all learn to how manage our to-do lists and calendars during the process of education or self-learning, but it’s more chaotic since now your project calendar depends on oth‐ ers’ calendars and priorities. Even if you have a project and/or product manager to keep the team on track, you still need to manage yourself to some extent. Without soft skills, things don’t get done, full stop. Don’t be that candidate who focu‐ ses only on technical skills but neglects building and demonstrating their soft skills in interviews. I’ll delve into the details of how ML interviews evaluate candidates on this pillar in Chapter 7 . Growing your skills in all three ML pillars is a tall order, and for entry-level roles you’re usually only expected to have a minimum (such as a 3/10) for each pillar, as illustrated in Figure 1-7 . For example, a job candidate who has some exposure to pro‐ gramming, even if they aren’t skilled or experienced, can be taught to improve. Ideally, you’d be stronger on at least one pillar (such as 5/10 for programming) that is most related to the particular ML role in order to stand out from other job candidates. Figure 1-7. Minimum required skill levels for ML jobs (example). For senior roles, the bare minimum requirements are higher, but a similar rule of thumb applies: clear the minimum skill requirements. From then on, you’ll be com‐ pared with other candidates on the skills that you are great in, depending on the role. Data scientists who only train ML models but don’t deploy them might not need to develop their programming skills as much as their ML theory and communication skills. For entry level roles, I’d argue that the communication pillar has a lower requirement (but not 0/10, please!) because it takes the hard-earned experience of working with a larger group of people, including nontechnical teammates, to raise it higher. This also gives some candidates an edge in this pillar: for those with a nontraditional back‐ ground, such as candidates who are self-taught or switching from software engineer roles or another field, the ability to adeptly tell a story and showcase a portfolio can set them apart from other candidates. Now that you’ve had an overview of the three pillars, you can use this mental model to stand out.'},\n",
       "   {'section': 'Machine Learning Skills Matrix',\n",
       "    'text': 'Congratulations! You’ve made it to the end of a pretty dense section! Now that you’ve gone through the overview of the machine learning lifecycle and three pillars of ML skills, it’s time for you to map your interests and skills to job titles. Table 1-3 will give you a rough idea of what skills you will need to learn in order to succeed in specific roles. On a scale from one to three stars, one star represents a skill of lower importance, and three stars represents a highly important skill. Table 1-3. Machine learning and data skills matrix Table 1-3 is often referred to in later chapters, so save or bookmark it! Taking a look at these skills, you can roughly map them to the three pillars of ML skills in the previous section, as shown in Table 1-4 . Table 1-4. Machine learning and data skills mapped to the three pillars of ML jobs It’s OK if you aren’t completely sure what each type of skill might entail just yet. In Chapter 2 , we will revisit this matrix, and there will be details and a checklist for self assessment. You don’t need to worry about every single skill; companies are aware that they are responsible for training up new grads. But you can stand out from other job candi‐ dates by showing that you are more easily trainable and can learn fast. An easy way to demonstrate this earlier in your ML career is to gain high-level (not necessarily deep) exposure to topics that you don’t have experience with yet. For example, even if you haven’t worked much with version control, it’s a bonus to be familiar with. You can achieve this by watching some videos (30 minutes) and installing/testing it out on a project (one hour). Now, let’s tie all this together. We’ve looked at the machine learning lifecycle ( Figure 1-5 ) and machine learning skills matrix ( Table 1-3 ). What’s left is to see what jobs are best for you to apply to now or to gain the skills for! To do so, let’s connect everything to the current trend of ML and data job titles ( Table 1-2 ). This is illustra‐ ted in Figure 1-8 . Figure 1-8. Common ML job titles and how they correspond to the ML lifecycle. The alphabetical annotations in Figure 1-8 can be mapped to those in Figure 1-5 , lis‐ ted here for convenience: • (A) Data • (B) Machine learning development • (C.1) ML/software infrastructure • (C.2) ML hypothesis testing/monitoring • (D) Reports and dashboards Figure 1-8 is often referred to in later chapters, so save or book‐ mark it! When you see a job title and check the details of the job posting, you can map it to what that job is likely responsible for in the day to day. In addition, based on what part of the ML lifecycle you’re interested in, you can better prepare and target your job applications, so you don’t accidentally bark up the wrong tree. Go to a job board of your choice, such as LinkedIn, Indeed, or others listed in Chap‐ ter 2 . Search “machine learning,” “data scientist,” “data,” “AI,” “generative AI,” and so on. What are you seeing? Do you see different types of jobs being advertised that all use ML?'},\n",

This book is called Machine Learning Interviews , but interviews are so much more than just interview questions. There are job applications and your resume, which are how you get interviews in the first place. If you don’t increase your chances of getting more interviews, then you won’t even get the chance to answer any inter‐ view questions! I’ll be covering the process from beginning to end, including how to follow up after the interview ( Chapter 9 ). To quickly set the stage, here are some common terms used in this book. When I use the term “interviewee,” I am referring to the person currently seeking employment, while the “interviewer” is currently employed at the company that the interviewee is interviewing to join. The interviewee is also referred to as a “candidate” or “job candidate,” since they are a candidate to be the successfully hired person (see Table 1-5 ). Table 1-5. Synonyms of common terms used in this book “Big tech” refers to the major, large tech companies. Because of constant changes in the industry—for example, Facebook rebranding to Meta as the parent company and Google doing something similar with Alphabet—the popular FAANG. 16 (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) acronym has already become outdated.

       "    'text': 'Now let’s get into the entire job-interview process. You’ll start by applying to jobs, then interviewing, and then, after some rounds of interviewing, finally receiving offers. This process is detailed in Figure 1-9 . Figure 1-9 is often referred to in later chapters, so save or book‐ mark it! Figure 1-9. ML interview process. Let’s imagine that you’re just starting out and applying for an ML role at a company with an established HR 17 and hiring process. You can begin your application in a few ways: by cold applying through the company website or job board (discussed in Chapter 2 ) or through a referral from someone within the team or company. You can also get interviews through cold messaging on LinkedIn or by emailing recruiters. Usually, at companies that have an HR-tracking software system, even if someone refers you, you’ll still need to upload a standard application into the online portal, which means you’ll need to prepare an updated resume and fill in your information. You may also choose to supplement your job-search efforts by working with a third-party recruiter, which is differentfrom an in from an inhouse recruiter who works or contracts specifically for the hiring company. Third-party recruiters often work with multiple compa‐ nies at once. Professional peers I know recommend working only with specific trusted third-party recruiters but warned me to beware those who make too many unrealistic promises or aren’t reputable. You can read more about third-party recruiters in this Forbes article . Using the first method—cold applying through company websites or third-party job boards—you’ve been browsing job boards like Indeed 18 as well as going directly to the career pages of companies you’re interested in working for. In this scenario, you don’t have someone referring you to the team or company (I’ll cover that in “Apply‐ ing via a Referral” on page 22 ). You’ve seen some ML-related jobs that seem relevant to you, and you clicked the links to apply. After you submit your application and the company has your information and resume, an HR member, recruiter, or whoever is in charge of resume screening, will proceed with the next step. The reality is that jobs have many applicants, and you should assume the first batch of applicants will be filtered before the hiring manager sees them. The hiring manager is the manager you’ll work with and report to if you join the team. So you can usually assume that a generalized HR partner or internal or external recruiters will be read‐ ing your resume first. These recruiters may be somewhat familiar with the roles they are screening resumes for, but they are still predominantly generalists, not as special‐ ized as the engineers and ML professionals you’ll actually be working with. This part of the screening process leads to several hidden criteria for your resume, which is why it might be baffling when your resume doesn’t clear this step even if you have a relevant background. It’s important to remember that these generalists will likely pass along your resume to the hiring manager if they: • See key technologies or experiences on your resume based on the job posting • See years of experience in key technologies or experiences or, in the case of entry • See years of experience in key technologies or experiences or, in the case of entrylevel or new-grad jobs, sufficient evidence that you can be easily trained • Understand that your skills and accomplishments are relevant, in plain language To determine whether your resume meets the criteria, the recruiter will likely be searching for keywords and comparing your resume to the job posting. They will not automatically “translate” skills on your resume for you. For example, if the job description says “Python” and your resume says “C++,” at this step they will likely not consider that, since both programming languages are object oriented, you could probably learn Python quickly if you put in the effort. There has been some debate at this stage on ATS , which is an acronym for applicant tracking system . While companies do use systems such as Workday to manage appli‐ cations, there hasn’t been concrete proof that companies are using them to program‐ matically filter out resumes at this step for each job posting ( Figure 1-10 ). Figure 1-10. Gergely Orosz (founder of The Pragmatic Engineer publication and former manager at Uber) on ATS (screenshot via Twitter). In practice, recruiters use them at most to filter resumes into a selection to fulfill existing criteria on the job posting, such as those mentioned on the previous page. I also haven’t seen ATS automatically filter out qualified candidates during full-time work experience, and once I was responsible for manually reading a PDF containing more than 50 resumes. However, I don’t want to claim that automated ATS rejections are fully untrue. To be safe, in this book I assume both standpoints have some truth to it. So even if ATS is an issue, the steps in this book will help you, since I’ll teach you the principles for how resume selection is conducted. (You can read more on ATS on thetechresume.com .) If you’re able to describe your experiences at a level that HR recruiters can under‐ stand is relevant to the job posting, you will increase your chances at the resume stand is relevant to the job posting, you will increase your chances at the resumescreening step. HR and recruiters, by nature of the role, are aware of higher-level technologies and what’s popular with the roles they’re hiring for but not the details, so it’s important for your resume to be optimized well. (Read more on how to opti‐ mize your resume in Chapter 2 .) Now that I’ve walked through cold applications directly via job boards or websites without any referral, I’ll provide some examples of how referrals can help you fast without any referral, I’ll provide some examples of how referrals can help you fasttrack the process. Let’s say you’re interested in an ML job at ARI Corporation. 19 You know an alum of your university who works on the ML team. You catch up with them and express your interest in the job. During the chat, you show the alum some of your personal ML projects, which are relevant to the ML job you’re interested in. The school alum agrees to refer you and gives you instructions for how to be referred, something that depends on the way the HR system of the company is set up. Since this alum knows you and is willing to vouch for your skills after seeing your personal projects, you get your resume to the “top of the pile.” Depending on the strength of the referral/recommendation, you may skip the resume screening alto‐ gether and get a highly guaranteed callback from a recruiter or even bypass the recruiter directly and get to the rest of the interview rounds. This is illustrated in Figure 1-11 . Note that I say “highly” guaranteed here since it still depends on various factors such as timing. As an example: maybe you got referred, but the job posting has coincidentally just been filled. Thus, you didn’t get to the rest of the interview. I will cover more on referrals and how to get them via professional networking in Chapter 2 . Figure 1-11. The interview process can be shortcut with a strong referral. You’ve been invited to an interview! How do you perform your best? Maybe time is limited; what do you do to ensure that you can maximize your outcome? My personal tactic is to first narrow down the types of questions that might be asked. For example, in the first round of an Amazon interview, the recruiter has outlined the format and it will focus on statistical theory questions. I will read online resources, skim over my notes, and see what topics I’m the weakest on. I will focus less on the questions that I know I can answer confidently and more on those that seem more likely to be asked but that I don’t know well. As to how I “guess” what will likely be asked, that is based mostly on conversations with the recruiter and my follow-up questions to the recruiter or hiring manager. I’m not super accurate at guessing, and this is similar to trying to guess what will come up in a university exam—it could work well, or it could backfire! Either way, there’s the trade-off between knowing a subset of questions well or know‐ ing all questions roughly but not as well (depth vs. breadth). When reviewing my preparation notes, I personally go for breadth, but your results may vary depending on how well you know the material already. Depending on your location and your interviewers’ location, there may be time zone differences. I try to find the time when I have the most energy possible. Sometimes the available interview time slots aren’t ideal, so I choose the lesser of the evils (for example, interviewing from GMT+8 and talking to someone in GMT-4 while travel‐ ing abroad). To make it easy to figure out time zones for candidates invited to an interview, it’s common for HR-scheduling software to have a calendar feature where you can input your preferred times and it will account for your local time zones. However, sometimes the time will be set via back-and-forth emails, and tools such as Cal‐ endly or Cal.com can help. As both an interviewer and interviewee, I am wary of scheduling right at the begin‐ ning of a workday. This is so that I have more time to prepare after I wake up. But of course, if no other time slots are available, then I will select the early time. As an interviewer, I’ve seen countless candidates’ interviews start late because of con‐ nection issues or using a new web-conferencing software—for example, not being able to set up Zoom on time because they hadn’t used it before. As a candidate, I’ve been tripped up and wasted time when needing to use Microsoft Teams because on my personal computers I only had Zoom and Google Meet. In the end, I used the browser version, but there was an issue with my login since my Microsoft student account had expired. We finally got it sorted out, a few minutes later. This could have been avoided if I had tried to sign in a bit earlier or on the day before the interview. Here are some tips to help your interview go more smoothly: Try your best to be in a quiet environment. Some software, such as Zoom, has pretty good built-in noise canceling, as do some wireless headphones. Check your audio and video beforehand. Video-wise, make sure the lighting is good and your camera lens is clean. Sound Video-wise, make sure the lighting is good and your camera lens is clean. Soundwise, make sure your mic sounds clear. On Windows and Mac, there are built-in camera and voice recording apps that I use. You could also start a new Zoom, Google Meet, or Teams session and run a test. Keep a mental list of backup options. Did the internet at your home suddenly go down before the interview? Is there a nearby cafe with (preferably secure) internet that you could go to? Can you use your phone data? Are there dial-in options via phone on the calendar invite? Knowing these things beforehand can help you a lot. I’ve had to dial in once to an interview, and thankfully, I knew that I had the option to. Congrats, your resume has made it past the resume screening! Now let’s go through an example to illustrate what might happen next. Let’s imagine that there were 200 applicants for the role. The recruiter has gone through them and removed 170 that either lacked relevant experience or for some reason didn’t seem to fit the role. Recall that this is based on the impression your resume gave the recruiter; it’s possible that with the same job title and same recruiter team, an improved resume would have passed. If you had a good referral, your resume might have already moved forward. Now that there are 30 applicants, the recruiter will call each of them; this is usually a shorter interview, 15 to 30 minutes long. We refer to this as the “recruiter screening” or “recruiter call.” Generally, the recruiter wants to see what you’re like as a person and if you’re easy to work with. If someone blatantly claims to have experience that they don’t, the call could reveal fabricated work or school experiences. There are other logistical issues to screen for, such as location, salary expectations, and legal status. The recruiter screening is more of a “smell test” instead of an in The recruiter screening is more of a “smell test” instead of an indepth test of your technical skills and experience. My tip for success is to optimize for one thing: that the recruiter understands that you are a good candidate, that your experience is relevant (or you can learn fast), and that you can fit well into the team and role they are hiring for. This is different from con‐ vincing a hiring manager of the same things, or an interview panel of senior MLEs. Instead, you will succeed here if you make the additional effort to connect your resume to the job description on this call. Here’s an example of some bullet points in a job description: • “The candidate has experience with recommender systems.” • “Experience with data processing such as Spark, Snowflake, or Hadoop.” • “The candidate has experience with Python.” A bad example of explaining your experience on the recruiter call for this job is: “For that past project, I used the ALS algorithm, which was implemented with PySpark.” A better example of explaining your experience on the recruiter call for this job is: “For that past project, I used the alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm, which is a recommender systems algorithm based off of matrix factorization, and I used PySpark, which is Spark that’s wrapped with a Python API.” Note that the italicized phrases also appear in the job description. The better example allows a recruiter to match up more of your skills to the job description, whereas the bad example doesn’t match up to the posted skills in an obvious manner. When you’re writing your resume, you have limited space; the real obvious manner. When you’re writing your resume, you have limited space; the realtime conversation of an interview is a chance for you to fill in gaps that the recruiter may not have noticed. It’s also important to expand on acronyms. This is true for interviews conducted with technical people too. I’m relatively specialized in recommender systems and rein‐ forcement learning, but I don’t work with computer vision tasks in my day-to-day work. I appreciated it when a candidate I interviewed was talking about computer vision projects and generally explained the more niche techniques. You can (and should) do this in a way that’s not condescending to your interviewer, whether they are a recruiter or part of your future team. The recruiter call is a good time for you as the candidate to assess the job as well. You can ask questions that you care about, to see if you should continue to interview. For example, I might ask about the team size and if this job focuses more on ML or data analyst responsibilities. You can also prepare some questions about the company and their products. For example, is the team’s current project focused on improving the click-through rate or long-term engagement? If you’re a user of the product, you might have a lot of ideas and questions to discuss. This is also a chance to show your enthusiasm and knowledge of the company. On to the next step. Good news: the recruiter cleared you! You explained your previ‐ ous experience well, and the recruiter was able to understand your past work and how it connects to the job description they have on hand. But it’s not over yet. You’re among 15 other candidates who succeeded at the first recruiter screening. The recruiter informs you of upcoming technical interviews which include ML theory, programming, and a case study interview. There are also behavioral interviews sprinkled throughout. If you pass those, you’ll make it to the on-site interview, which is often the final round. These days, there are also virtual on on-site interview, which is often the final round. These days, there are also virtual onsites/final rounds. If you pass the final round, you’ll be extended an offer. Let’s break down the various types of interviews that take place after the recruiter screening, the first being technical interviews. Technical interviews are typically con‐ ducted with technical individual contributors (ICs), such as an MLE or a data scientist. There may be multiple rounds of technical interviews; there could be one that is a data-focused coding round or one in which the interviewer presents some fictitious example data and asks you to use SQL or Python pandas/NumPy (sometimes there are multiple questions, and you use various programming tools throughout the inter‐ view). I’ll expand more on this type of interview structure and interview questions in Chapter 5 . Apart from ML and data-focused programming interviews, you might be asked brainteaser-type questions. For this type of interview, you might use an interview platform such as CoderPad or HackerRank, where the interviewer presents you with a question and you code in the online integrated development environment (IDE) that both you and your interviewer can see in real time. Sometimes you’ll get other formats, such as technical deep dives, systems design, take-home exercises in a pri‐ vate repo or Google Colab, and so on. I’ll elaborate on how to prepare for these types of interviews in Chapters 5 and 6 . These subsequent interview rounds could further reduce the number of candidates before the final round. In our example, fifteen candidates passed the recruiter screen, and eight passed the first round of technical interviews. After the second round of technical interviews, we’re left with three candidates who will proceed to the on-site interview. Interspersed during the interview process are questions meant to assess how you react in certain situations. The intent often is to use past experience to predict future performance and understand how you react to high-stress or difficult situations. In addition, these questions assess your soft skills, such as communication and team‐ work skills. You’ll want to prepare a few past experiences and relay them in a story‐ telling fashion. For example, during your first recruiter call, the recruiter might ask about a time when you dealt with a difficult timeline on a project. Once you’ve responded you won’t be out of the woods yet. During the on-site, an hour is often dedicated to behavioral questions. And in some technical interviews, you might be asked a couple of questions that are a mix between a purely technical question and a behavioral question. I’ll help you succeed with behavioral interviews in Chapter 7 , which also has tips on company-specific preparation, such as Amazon’s Leadership Principles . For many companies there is an “on-site” final round or the virtual equivalent. These are usually back-to-back interviews. For example, starting in the morning, you might meet with a technical director for a case study interview and then a senior data scien‐ tist for a programming interview. After a lunch break, you might meet with two data scientists who ask about ML theory, and then the hiring manager asks more behavio‐ ral questions and probes about your past experiences. In addition to technical inter‐ viewers, you may speak with a stakeholder (e.g., a product manager on an adjacent team that the team you’re interviewing for works closely with). In several final-round interviews I’ve been through, there was a product manager interviewer or someone from another department that the ML team worked closely with, such as marketing or advertising. Some companies will have an additional mini round after this, such as a quick chat with a skip level (your manager’s manager).In this chapter, you’ve learned about various ML roles, the ML lifecycle, and the dif‐ ferent responsibilities that map onto the ML lifecycle. You’ve also seen how you make your way from the beginning of the process to the final round of interviews. There’s a lot to prepare for and to learn about, but now you have an overview and hopefully some thoughts on how you can target your preparations. Now that this chapter has set the foundation, I’ll walk through a detailed job applica‐ tion guide, including a resume guide, to help you greatly increase your chances of getting interviews.'}]},\n",

       "    'text': 'This section will walk you through choosing a strategy for applying for jobs, and the following resume guide will help you create an optimized job application. Some folks have had success getting jobs without any networking. In fact, my second job was a cold application; I didn’t know anyone working at the company at the time. But from a probability standpoint, I would need to send out more applications and do more interviews if I applied only to companies where I didn’t have any referrals. The following is a mental equation I use to assess this: The more applications you send out, regardless of EPA, the more you increase your chances of getting an interview. Indiscriminately sending out a vast number of appli‐ cations—a “spray and pray” approach—might be able to make up for a low EPA. On the other hand, if you want to have the same number of interviews but submit fewer applications, you’ll need to increase your EPA on average. Filtering through job postings for suitable ones or tailoring your resume can increase your EPA. You’ll need fewer applications to get the same number of interviews (most of the time). So which type of strategy should you choose? You don’t have to get referrals or tailor your resume, but be prepared to send out more applications in this scenario. It’s your choice! If you prefer the mass-application approach, feel free to skip the following sections, though I recommend reading them. Here are some strategies to increase your EPA, which I’ll elaborate on in the follow‐ ing section (see Figure 2-1 ): Get job referrals. Get referred for ML jobs and use networking to increase your chances of being referred. Vet jobs before applying. If you invest the time to find and apply for jobs that your skills are more suitable for, that can increase your EPA. Tailor your resume. In conjunction with vetting jobs, you can rearrange your resume to highlight keywords and skills that are most relevant to your target jobs. Figure 2-1. Job applications and their effectiveness per application. I have had good success applying to jobs that I’ve had referrals for, but does that mean I apply only for jobs when I have a referral? To be honest, no. I also send out resumes for jobs that may not be the best fit, and do not always tailor my resume. You don’t have to maximize your EPA for every single application, but as long as you are getting some referrals, you are increasing your EPA on average. You can mix and match depending on your time commitments; sometimes I just don’t have the time or energy to reach out to someone to ask for a referral, or don’t feel that I know the connection at the company well enough to ask. So I just cold apply. In Chapter 1 , I mentioned that job referrals can help you rise to the top of the “stack of resumes” or even guarantee that you get a recruiter call. In some cases, if you’re a referred (i.e., recommended) candidate, you can even bypass the initial recruiter call and skip to a later stage of the interview process, as illustrated in Figure 1-11 . In this chapter, I mention how referrals are one way to improve your EPA. I personally think it’s great to make use of referrals when possible. This does require that the per‐ son referring you is willing to put their reputation on the line, because by referring you, they are suggesting that you will be successful once you are hired. The following are three examples, with screenshots, of reaching out for referrals, cof‐ fee chats that led to a referral, and informational interviews. A common misconception is that referrals are a silver bullet to get‐ ting hired. This is not true since a referral often only gets you through the first round of the process; the rest is up to you. The subsequent interview rounds will still put you through the wringer. Here’s an example of an intern candidate I once referred to my team. We had met when he attended an ML journal club meetup that I had coorganized called AISC ( Figure 2-2 ). After another event I hosted, I reached out to him because he had pre‐ sented a great five-minute “lightning” talk. We had a brief back and forth that con‐ cluded the conversation, after which we didn’t speak for another two years! Figure 2-2. Referral example 1: brief conversation after meeting at an ML journal club. Later, in 2022, he reached out to me to chat about a role in the company where I was working. Since I recognized him from when he attended the ML journal club a few years ago and remembered our conversation, I gladly referred him ( Figure 2-3 ). Figure 2-3. Referral example 1: referring an intern job candidate. This is a good example of reaching out when you’ve known each other and are pro‐ fessional acquaintances, which could result in a referral, interview, or job offer down the road. Here’s another example of a “warm” 1 outreach ( Figure 2-4 ). This person messaged me, mentioning a conference we had both attended. We had spoken only briefly at the conference, but even that mention was enough to get my attention in a crowded inbox. I agreed to have a quick call and answer some questions about the job posting. Figure 2-4. Referral example 2: warm reachout to ask about a job posting. During the call, I asked the person about their past experiences. After hearing about their relevant data experience, I offered to refer them before they explicitly asked ( Figure 2-5 ). Here are some reasons I agreed to speak to the candidate and to refer them: State a connection. They stated where they had met me before. In some cases, job seekers mention reading my blog or seeing me speak. They may mention something as simple as seeing one of my LinkedIn posts (it’s important to be specific about which one). Be specific. They linked the job posting or mentioned details about why they were reaching out. Sometimes I get very broad questions, such as “How do I enter data sci‐ ence?” In those situations, even if I have a coffee chat with them, I’ll be duplicat‐ ing and repeating information that they could get in one of my blog posts, or from this book! A call or meeting should be meant for a deeper conversation. Politeness goes a long way. They weren’t pushy or rude and were very respectful of my time. The intern candidate in job referral example 1 also demonstrated these traits in their reachout. Here’s an example where someone I hadn’t met before reached out for a coffee chat ( Figure 2-6 ). Note that she mentioned seeing a specific LinkedIn post I wrote, which echoes the tip to state a connection with the person you’re reaching out to. This mes‐ sage was for a general chat, not a specific job posting, but the fact she brought up both AI and game development, which are specific niches I’m interested in, was enough to prompt me to set up a meeting. This was relatively easy to do as we were both based in the downtown Toronto area at the time. Figure 2-6. Referral example 3: coffee-chat request. During the meeting, we chatted in depth about various ML and AI topics and game development, which gave me the confidence that this was someone I could keep in mind to refer. In fact, my team was hiring at the time, which I mentioned. Sadly, she situation, she offered to refer me to her new employer ( Figure 2-7 )! Figure 2-7. Referral example 3: UNO Reverse referral offer. As you can see from these three examples, you can get referrals with a thoughtful message. Attending events and conferences can increase the number of warm con‐ nections you can reach out to when the time comes. Many experienced leaders in the industry are proponents of referrals. Here are some examples: So, how do you “network”? When I was a student, this term greatly confused me. “Say I go to conferences and meetups, so what? People don’t want to refer me to jobs just by meeting me once…” If you think that, then you’re probably right—people usually won’t refer you unless there’s a reason for them to do so. Luckily, many companies, especially big tech and larger companies, give referral bonuses. This means that if an employee refers someone who gets hired, they receive money or rewards. Usually, there is a requirement that the new hires have to stay for six months or so to prevent abuse of the reward system. Referral programs incentiv‐ ize employees to find people in their networks to refer to job openings. In addition, ML is in high demand, so some companies even struggle to hire. Many companies and teams source qualified candidates through referrals from friends, for‐ mer colleagues, university peers, and more. So even if you don’t have a strong net‐ work (yet), people do have an incentive to keep an eye out for suitable job candidates. These are the steps I use: 1. Look at meetups, conferences, and the like happening in person or online. 2. Go to events (usually free). 3. At each event, meet just one new person. With this small goal, over time you will meet more people working at various compa‐ nies. Even if you go to only one event per month, over the course of a year you will have met 12 people who may be willing to vouch for you when you apply to their employer in the future. Or you may even meet startup founders who can hire you more easily because they know you. Networking is a long-term investment, and the rewards will appear over the long Networking is a long-term investment, and the rewards will appear over the longterm horizon. One misconception that people have is that networking only encom‐ passes this scenario: you first find some jobs you’re interested in and then reach out to people related to that company or job. If you’re networking only when you’re already applying, you will be stressed out and stretched thin on time—not to men‐ tion, it might be too late. If you’ve been meeting people and know people from other companies, or even alumni from your university, bootcamp, and so forth, you can reach out when you see a job posting at their company. If you aren’t sure how to start, refer to the suc‐ cessful examples in the previous section. Even if you don’t think you’re “good at” meeting new people, it’s a skill that can be learned and practiced. Set the small goal of meet‐ ing just one new person when you go to any networking event, meetup, or conference. It really adds up. Beyond getting referrals, there are strong benefits of networking. Here is an example from when I was a new graduate: I met two final-round interviewers (director level) at two different companies before I even applied to their job postings, merely by attending conferences and meetups. 4 I got both offers. Neither of them referred me, but I still got the benefit of networking since both had interacted with me at some point; they were warm connections, rather than interviewers I was meeting for the first time in the interview.'},\n",

       "    'text': 'I mentioned tailoring your resume as a way to increase your EPA, but whether you plan to tailor your resume or not, you’ll still need at least one version of it. This sec‐ tion will guide you through creating your first resume. If you already have one, you can skim this section for tips and best practices, then head to the part where you tai‐ lor your resume or other sections you’re interested in. Before you start writing your resume, you should jot down an inventory of what you’ve done in the past. This inventory includes past work experience, ML projects at school or at work—anything that could be relevant to ML and data science. If you don’t have any personal or school projects or work experience outside of ML, you can still take an inventory; this will help you figure out what else you need to learn to close the gap between your current skills and your target ML role. As an example, when I was a new grad (with less than one year of working experi‐ ence), my inventory looked like this: University • Econometrics research paper about video game prices on Steam, with data I scra‐ ped myself • Econometrics research paper about Reddit engagement, with data I scraped myself First full-time job • ML churn model I built Write down a list of jobs or major projects (school, personal, etc.) that you’ve done. Feel free to focus on ML-related ones, but at this stage, anything loosely related can count. (Did you do data cleaning? Use Python? Add it.) Include your education, cer‐ tificates, anything relevant. These don’t have to be in resume-bullet form; they can just be an unformatted text list or jotted on a notepad. Set a timer for 30 minutes, do it, and come back. This book will miss you but needs you to do this! From the inventory that you listed in “Exercise 2-1” on page 37 , pick three to five experiences you feel are most relevant to ML roles in general. Refer to Table 1-3 , the ML and data skills matrix, again. For your targeted ML roles, are the experiences on your list relevant so far or not? If you feel that you don’t have three relevant ML or data experiences, you can temporarily pad out three experiences with the work or school experiences that were the most substantial and “impressive.” Don’t worry about it being perfect at this stage; you can always go back to your longer inventory and pick another one later. Next, list everything you did related to those top three experiences: this includes not only technical parts related to coding, ML, or data but also soft skills, such as present‐ ing the results to your team or organizing a group chat to coordinate teammates. To continue using the example from my own initial, unrefined inventory, here’s what I would include: University student experience example Econometrics research paper about Reddit engagement, with data I scraped myself • Scraped Reddit with Python • Cleaned data with Python • Performed statistical modeling with Python, Stata • Visualized results with Python • Created presentation of project with LaTeX • Presented project overview and results to seminar class of 10 people and professor First job (less than one year experience) example My first ML churn model • Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with SQL, Python • Cleaned data with SQL • Trained logistic regression model with SAS on tabular data; created ensem‐ ble model in SAS • Ran model evaluation and analyzed results with SAS, SQL, Python • Created simplified and cleaner visualization to use in presentation with Excel, PowerPoint • Presented the results with PowerPoint • Collaborated with ML engineer to put the model in production From the list of past experiences you wrote down in “Exercise 2-1” on page 37 , pick the top three to expand on as in the previous example, writing out everything you did related to them, including your use of technical or soft skills. Now that you have a starter list of your past experiences to refine, let’s look at the sections of a resume. These are the core sections of your resume: • Experience • Education These are optional sections: • Skills summary • Volunteering • Interests • Other sections (your name of choice) Don’t worry about filling in the optional sections yet; doing so will depend on what you have in your core sections and whether they are already lengthy. Use the top three experiences you provided in your inventory for “Exercise 2-1” on page 37 . You should also gather the following pieces of information: • Job title • Place where you worked • Time frame you worked there (e.g., May 2018 to November 2021) • Bullet points of your responsibilities from “Exercise 2-2” • Any other information that might be expected in your region, industry, or work culture An example of a section of your initial resume might look like this: Data Scientist, ARI Corporation (May 2021 to Present) • Design and develop collaborative filtering models for web page personalization • Develop ETL 5 production code that aggregates predictive model scores according to user specification • Develop predicting ensemble model to optimize marketing campaign planning and touchpoints You don’t need to format your resume in a template just yet; it’s more efficient to pin down the contents first before you deal with formatting (sometimes adding just one word breaks your beautiful layout and you spend more time than it’s worth to fix it…). Note that I’ll link to some common templates at the end of this section. Here are some more tips to improve your initial bullet points: Use action verbs to start the sentences. For example, instead of writing “Image recognition with TensorFlow,” write “ Developed image recognition model with TensorFlow.” (The action verb is itali‐ cized for illustration; you don’t need to italicize it on your resume.) This can help clarify what you did during your experience, not just the outcome (which was likely a team effort).

Tinker around with the wording to see what the most essen‐ tial information is to keep. The points here are pretty similar to the Experience section; you should also include the following pieces of information: • School/institution you attended • Location, country (optional but recommended) • Time frame when you studied there (e.g., May 2018 to November 2021) • Bullet points of major projects and assignments related to ML or data • Any other information that might be expected in your region, industry, or work culture The following is a example of what this section might look like: University of Waterloo Waterloo, Canada, 2010–2015 • Scraped and cleaned sales data with Python, pandas • Forecasted video game prices with ARIMA time-series model Now that you have the core sections, take a look at the optional sections. Do you have a lot of projects and experience in your core section? If you do, then you may not have space to add volunteering. For example, when I was a new graduate, I added a skills summary and volunteering experience section to pad out the space since I barely had any experience. If you have other experience, I suggest that you focus first on refin‐ ing your existing bullet points before you start padding your resume with irrelevant content. Too much additional content might only serve to distract recruiters and hiring managers from noticing the most crucial and important skills that you have. Take a look at your Experience and Education sections so far. Do they look robust and relevant enough for any of the target roles in Figure 1-8 ? Are there any bullet points that your peers interested in ML have but that you’re missing? Don’t worry yet—we’ll create an action plan at the end of this chapter and throughout this book. The point here is to start self-reflecting and connecting your experiences to the ML jobs we talked about earlier. For now, are there any volunteering experiences, inter‐ ests, or additional experiences that you have that are relevant? Write them down. The skills summary is a place to list a bunch of programming languages and frame‐ works you have had exposure to. Beware: don’t exaggerate too much; if you list a framework or library here that doesn’t match up with what you’ve elaborated on in the bullet points, the technical interviewers might ask you to elaborate. Everything you’ve listed on your resume is fair game to ask about. Here’s an example: Skills summary • Python • TensorFlow, PyTorch • NumPy/pandas, Polars • C++ • And so on… When I review resumes, I tend to skip this area and go straight to the work experi‐ ence bullet points. However, this may vary depending on the reviewer; a skills section might be more relevant to a recruiter who’s trying to match off of the job description, for example, and the more you have listed there, the more likely there will be overlap with a job description. For this section, you can just use bullet points on one line instead of grouping them under an experience unless (1) your volunteering experience is very impactful and substantial, in which case I might just put it under the Experience section, or (2) you’re really trying to pad out your resume. Here’s an example: Volunteering experience • Volunteer, SIGIR Conference 2023, Taipei • Volunteer, Toronto Machine Learning Summit, 2020, Toronto • And so on… Some people recommend including this section to show that you have some interests outside of work. In my opinion, the general rule applies that if you don’t have space, you can drop these optional sections without consequence. On the other hand, you can keep it if your interests are something cool like chess grandmaster or equestrian cup title holder—whatever you’re proud of. When I was a student, I padded this area with the following: Interests • Team Fortress 2 scrap trader, 2012–2015 • AISC (formerly Toronto Deep Learning Series) blog editor, 2019 • And so on… Yes, I put video-game-related interests in my resume. Yes, I did trade scrap metal, an informal online currency 6 in Team Fortress 2, an online game. There’s a whole econ‐ omy around it. Yes, it was really because I had to pad the space and for no other rea‐ son. However, no one asked me about it. You can choose to add other sections, which pretty much follow the same format as the Volunteering and Interests sections. I encourage you to do this if you have nota‐ ble interests, volunteering, and whatnot that would make more sense to rename under their own sections. For example, once I started public speaking, I had enough entries to warrant a new section, replacing my Volunteering section on my resume: Public speaking • Keynote speaker, O’Reilly AI Superstream (MLOps) • Keynote speaker, PyCon DE & PyData Berlin • And so on… • “Resume Checklist” to make sure your resume looks polished (University of Waterloo) • Action verbs for when you run out of ideas: “Action Verbs for Resume Writing” (University of Washington) • Resume format and checklist via CareerCup (North America focused) • Resume templates on Overleaf (LaTeX markdown): The one I’ve used for the last five years is AltaCV (two-column). I personalized the template by removing the graphics, leaving only text. A popular single-column template is Modern-Deedy . That’s it for this section. As usual, be sure to check if there are any regional expecta‐ tions for information you should include in your resume. I also have included a resume-related FAQ at the end of this chapter. Now that you have your basic resume, let’s look into how to tailor it for common ML job titles (see Figure 1-8 ). If the job title you’re looking for isn’t in Figure 1-8 , you can map it to the ML lifecycle ( Figure 1-5 ) and use the same tips for similar roles in the ML lifecycle. Recall that you don’t have to tailor your resume for every job applica‐ tion, but even if you do it only for the most common job titles that you are interested in, you can increase your EPA on average. If you refer back to the skills matrix ( Table 1-3 ), you can probably see why tailoring your resume can be useful: if you have “programming tools” and “statistics” skills, you can possibly apply for both DS (data scientist) and MLE roles, but to highlight additional skills that differ between the two roles, changing some bullet points will help market your skills better. The ML skills matrix ( Table 1-3 ) helps you narrow down job titles that fit your past experience better, but from then on, your job search is dependent on the actual job descriptions. Once you start to look at job descriptions, you might sometimes see DS postings that involve skills mapped to the data analyst role (“product” data science), and some‐ times the job posting could map more to the MLE role on the matrix. Head over to the job postings search engine of your choice! I personally like to start with LinkedIn since I’m familiar with the platform, but most jobs from bigger com‐ panies are cross-posted on all the major platforms anyway. Start typing in a few job titles (you can use Figure 1-8 for the common ML job titles as inspiration). Click on ones that catch your eye and look at the job descriptions. Are there any keywords that match up with bullet points on your resume? After browsing some more, note any keywords, tools, or frameworks that show up repeatedly. Do you have that skill, or would it be worth learning so that your resume can match up more closely with those job descriptions? In my own experience, my job title has been data scientist for all of my full-time roles, but I’ve always been focused on building and deploying ML models into a product or improving the ML product. Based on the matrix, I’ve done everything from MLE to applied scientist, and even some MLOps-related roles. Let’s now imagine that I’m browsing jobs online and you’re looking over my shoul‐ der. I’m going to search “Spotify machine learning” and start clicking into the results, beginning with the example in Figure 2-8 . Figure 2-8. Screenshot of Spotify data scientist job posting via LinkedIn. After reading this Data Scientist posting ( Figure 2-8 ), I write down what I think is important: • Cooperation with stakeholders, communication (mentioned multiple times and at the top of the bullet points) • Perform data analysis, using BigQuery or SQL • Some statistical modeling such as linear, logistic regression Next, I’ll look back at my resume experience—for example, the bullet points for a previous job where I made my first ML churn model—and map it to the data scientist posting. If you haven’t finished up your resume yet, you can use the inventory list that you made for “Exercise 2-2” on page 39 . The most relevant out of the points from my first ML churn model (see “Take Inven‐ tory of Your Past Experience” on page 37 ) that I initially wrote down are: • Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) with SQL, Python • Created simplified and cleaner visualization to use in presentation with Excel, PowerPoint • Presented the results with PowerPoint Based on the ML lifecycle, it feels like this role is more focused on reporting and data analysis (step D in Figure 1-5 ), so I should make sure I am interested in that part of the lifecycle before proceeding to actually tailoring my resume. If I’m interested in applying for this data scientist role, I’ll focus on the three points I listed from the job description and shorten or remove the other bullets. Recall the inventory list you created for “Exercise 2-2” on page 39 ; if you have other experiences more relevant to this job posting, swap them in. If your current resume is pretty rele‐ vant to this job posting, then you can keep it as is. If you do remove some less relevant points, keep an eye out on the space remaining in your resume. How much you remove depends on how much space you have on your resume! I have more experience now so I err on the side of removing more, while early on I chose to pad more points and hardly ever removed points. It’s fine to remove things as long as the core is there; if the interviewers are interested in how I train more complex ML models—a bullet point I removed since it wasn’t on the job description—they can ask me in the interview. Let’s continue to scroll through the search results for “Spotify machine learning” and look at another posting in Figure 2-9 . Figure 2-9. Screenshot of Spotify machine learning engineer job posting via LinkedIn. As with the first example, I read through the Machine Learning Engineer posting and write down what I think is important: • Implementing ML in production • Prototyping • Testing and tooling, platform improvements • Collaboration with cross-functional teams Based on these points, it seems that this role is more focused on ML model training, with some parts on the ML infrastructure, which are illustrated by steps B and C.1 respectively in the machine learning lifecycle ( Figure 1-5 ). If I’m interested in applying for this machine learning engineer role, I’ll focus on these relevant three bullet points and shorten or remove the other bullets. To do so, I’ll look back to the list of seven points from “My first ML churn model” example and map it to the MLE posting. The most relevant points are: • Trained model with SAS • Ran model evaluation and analyzed results with SAS, SQL, Python • Collaborated with ML engineer to put the model in production • Cleaned data with SQL The inventory you created for “Exercise 2-2” on page 39 can be reused for different types of roles without the need to rewrite anything. It’s good to remember that com‐ munication and collaboration skills are also important to companies, and you’ll notice these skills listed a lot in all types of job postings. Don’t forget to include the points where you were collaborating with other teams or presenting your work to another organization in at least one of your resume bullet points. This is especially relevant for folks who think they don’t have enough “ML experience”! Your experi‐ ence analyzing data, as well as communicating it, is important and can strengthen your resume more than you might think. I’d recommend making the technologies you used in your past role very clear in your job experience bullet points. You can list them inline or at the end of a bullet point, depending on the space you have and what is most concise. Otherwise, if you have space, feel free to include a skills section in your resume. Zooming out a bit now that you’ve been head down crafting and refining your resume: the companies and teams you’re applying to have posted this job for a rea‐ son. They have a gap on their team and want someone to fill that gap. Therefore, your application and resume should focus on convincing the hiring com‐ mittee that you are a candidate who can fill that gap and be part of their team. This includes: • Real and relevant experience that you can apply to the job, including transferable skills: skills that aren’t identical but can easily be transferred between domains. • Soft skills—you can work well with people in the team and communicate with broader groups of people, such as product managers, and so on. • Technical skills—you can make individual technical contributions. • Evidence that you can onboard to an existing project or gain enough context to start something new. These skills are succinctly described in the three pillars of ML roles that we explored in Chapter 1 . You can show many skills and experiences in your resume, but not all of them. For example, take a quick look at your resume: does it completely lack any examples of teamwork? Are there other points that could help show you’re a person who can learn quickly (if you don’t have as many relevant working experiences)? If things look good so far, start applying, but if not, take some time to keep improving your resume.'},\n",

       "    'text': 'Now that you have tailored your resume, it’s time to apply! Head to job boards (you can use the ones listed at the beginning of this chapter for inspiration). I think it’s OK to start applying even if you’re not sure if your skills and resume are perfect yet; if you apply for a few jobs and don’t even get a recruiter callback, that means your resume or skills need to be improved more. You may even find that continuing to improve your resume and spending time on getting referrals are enough to improve your EPA and start getting calls. It’s a learning process, and even if you don’t start out perfect, the goal is to move toward getting callbacks, through the volume of applications you submit or through applications with higher effectiveness. Hopefully, you’ve done the previous exercises and it’s not your first time viewing the job descriptions of ML roles you’re interested in. If you vet the jobs that you’re apply‐ ing for, you can increase the chances of getting interviews. In my experience, this step is best used in conjunction with tailoring your resume, because if you’re not tailoring your resume, you might as well mass apply and hope you happen to apply for the jobs that match you the best. So how do you filter jobs? Remember the variety of ML roles that were introduced in Chapter 1 ? Let’s cut through the noise so that you can focus on marketing your skills to the roles that best fit your experience. Refer to the common ML job titles in Figure 1-8 : which roles do you feel suit you best? If you are most interested in a job that you don’t currently have the experience In the skills matrix, Table 1-3 , you can see right off the bat that the role of data ana‐ lyst can have overlapping skills with the data scientist role, which in turn overlaps a lot with the role of the MLE. The good news is that with a few of these skills in your skills list, you can apply for one or more of these positions. And don’t worry—recall that for entry-level roles, as long as you have one or two of the skills listed, you’re good to go for applying to those jobs. It’s also perfectly normal for new grads to have strong skills in one pillar of ML skills but not in all, which most employers understand and welcome. Mapping your skills to the matrix is only part of the process, though, because the reality is that this matrix has to be taken with a heavy dose of “it depends.” That’s why the next section of this chapter asks you to analyze a real job posting. I’ve seen plenty of job seekers encounter this situation: “this job title is data scientist; why were the questions in the interview about data engineering (or insert something unexpected)?” Recall that an ML title depends on the company or organization plus which team the role is in plus where in the machine learning lifecycle the role is (refer back to Figure 1-3 ). As an extreme example, I’ve been through a “data scientist” interview where they did not ask any statistics or machine learning theory questions nor any data-related ques‐ tions. Instead, the interview consisted of a few rounds of LeetCode-style (coding quiz) programming questions. 8 I wondered how they could gauge whether I would be a good ML practitioner whose core work centers around data when the questions were fully copied from a generalist software engineer loop. In hindsight, it was proba‐ bly because that role was not really responsible for training ML models at all. Because of the often-ambiguous nature of job titles, it can be difficult as a candidate to decide what topics to prepare for. Sure, you can spend time reviewing ML theory as well as grinding some coding quizzes, but your time is stretched thin, and you could be preparing for something that won’t even be asked. I’ve seen candidates rejected from jobs, not because they weren’t strong ML candi‐ dates, but rather because they were applying for the “wrong” roles. Confusingly, those roles had the same job titles as ones that the candidate would actually be suc‐ cessful at. The key is to develop the intuition for how to categorize a job title depend‐ ing on the job description and find the best roles to apply for that suit your skills. Some of these job titles show up in multiple sections, and that’s OK! Well, it’s not that OK when it causes confusion and rejections, but you’ll be able to better vet and target them by the end of this chapter. When I apply to jobs, I glance at the job title, but to ensure I’m applying to the right jobs for my skills, I do the following: • Look at the job description. • Categorize the job responsibilities; where is it in the machine learning lifecycle ( Figure 1-4 )? • Determine whether the job title and job description match up enough; for exam‐ ple, if the job title is machine learning engineer but the description makes it seem somewhat like a data engineering role (which my past experience isn’t relevant to), I will pass on the role. Polish up your resume and apply to one job. The worst they can do is ignore your application. Try it! It can be worth it to track applications so that it’s easier to remember what jobs you have applied for. If you’ve passed the resume screening and at least reached the recruiter screening, tracking those applications can help you remember to follow up, in case you don’t hear back during the time frame when they told you they’d let you know. I used to track most of my applications, but to be honest, I now think you should only track applications where you’ve at least passed the resume screening. Especially if you mass applied to any job related to ML, there’s no point in spending the addi‐ tional time to track your applications, and not tracking them won’t affect your pass rate. One scenario where you might find it useful to track your applications is if you personally plan to summarize or visualize your journey and stats later on. I do think it’s useful to keep track of who I’ve interviewed with, so I can reach out if I have more questions about the team or company. I could also reach out to them if I interview with the same company a few years later. Recall that networking is a long interview with the same company a few years later. Recall that networking is a longterm investment with long-term horizons! As for tools to track applications and interviews, I think Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, or another simple spreadsheet tool is more than adequate. Table 2-2 is an example of how I tracked applications and interviews in Google Sheets (names are fictionalized). Table 2-2. Spreadsheet example of tracking applications and interviews After you’ve received some offers, you can then look back to see how many inter‐ views you did. It’s also nice to have a list of relevant interviewers and their emails in case you want to reach out to them a few years later. However, I’ve heard from some people that keeping track of their application-to-interview-to-offer ratio can make their mood go more down than up, so it depends on you.'},\n",

       "    'text': 'I’ve walked through the resume guide, but there still are some additional components of job applications, such as project portfolios and online certifications. This section gives some best practices and FAQs. Project portfolios are basically project examples. As a student, I had a few side projects (aka personal projects). I put the code up on GitHub and also created some figures/visualizations. GitHub is a pretty common place to host projects, but some candidates publish their project portfolios as a website, such as a Heroku site. Recall that the goal of your application and interviews is to convince the employer that you’re a good candidate for the job: you have the skills or can easily be trained for the job. For junior, entry-level, and new-graduate candidates: if you don’t yet have a lot of work experience but do have a project portfolio, it can help showcase your skills and increase the hiring manager’s and hiring team’s confidence in your abilities. But if you have plenty of work experience already, there are marginal returns to hav‐ ing a project portfolio; in interviews, employers would rather discuss your past work, case studies, technical deep dives of past projects, and so forth. You may still benefit from having a project portfolio on GitHub because much of the code and many of the models that you developed in your past job experience may be proprietary, so you might not have code samples that you can share. In that case, showcasing a personal project in a GitHub repository or contributions to open source projects would be useful. Here are some common mistakes I’ve seen in candidates’ project portfolios and how to avoid them: Not having a README or overview about the project If you’re on GitHub, follow the instructions to create one that renders. Using cliché datasets such as MNIST or widely available tutorials Many other candidates likely have the exact same code examples, and interview‐ ers can tell. Enhance common datasets with custom data that you gathered your‐ self or scrape your own. Only dumping your code, without any explanation or inline documentation Add more code comments to help your interviewer understand what they’re looking at. Having a confusing or highly nested folder structure Use your judgment to tidy things up; don’t just dump a bunch of .py scripts. The real consequences of these mistakes are that the recruiter or person filtering out candidate resumes wastes too much time trying to click through your GitHub or website to find your relevant code. They run out of time (less than one minute per resume) and simply pass on your resume. For your portfolio to make a difference and boost your application, you should make it easy to navigate and understand at a glance. For that reason, I suggest putting important visualizations on the README and clearly marking which code files the reviewer should click on. When I review resumes, I don’t place too much importance on certifications if the candidate has past ML experience or ML projects that they did on their own time (side projects). If the candidate does not have prior relevant experience, then relevant projects and project portfolios make the biggest difference. I’d recommend you build that up in parallel with earning certifications. Some certifications hold more weight than others—recall again that the goal is to set yourself apart from other job candidates—so courses that are seen as more compre‐ hensive and practical could help. Examples include the Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure Cloud certifications. If your entire resume consists of certifications that anyone could complete in a weekend, then your resume won’t stand out. Interviewing.io analyzed data from many job candidates and found that in its data sample, putting certifications on LinkedIn had a negative impact on the perceived quality of the candidate. 9 Their guess is that more qualified candidates would put work experience or relevant projects on their profiles and resumes while less qualified candidates who didn’t have either would fill up their profiles with certifications. Regardless, candidates have found success with certifications, especially if they come from a nontraditional educational background. Here’s a crucial tip: watch out for diminishing returns. In economics, this means that once you’ve done several more units of something, you benefit less and less from each subsequent unit. In this case, if you’ve done five certifications, it doesn’t make too much difference whether you complete three more or five more. Five certifications will look pretty much the same on a resume as eight or ten. A mistake I see entry-level candidates make is taking the same 100-level/introductory courses again and again. For example, they will take the beginner courses on Cour‐ sera, then take another similar beginner course on Udacity, and then on edX. To an interviewer, this is almost the same as if you’d taken one single beginner course since the contents of the three courses overlap so much. It doesn’t help you stand out against other candidates who have taken more advanced courses or have good portfo‐ lio projects. So once the number of online certifications you’ve taken approaches three to five, you should try to diversify your experience: • Make sure your certifications are from reputable sources; don’t list them if they seem like they were completed in a weekend. If this removes everything in your current certification list, you should continue with the following two steps. • Take certifications in more specialized fields of your interest, such as reinforce‐ ment learning or natural language processing (NLP). • Start a side project and build a project portfolio on GitHub. Table 2-3 summarizes the general decision criteria I suggest. Table 2-3. Should you keep doing online courses and certifications? The same criteria for deciding whether online certifications are useful for you apply to the question of graduate school: is the ROI enough? Master’s degrees usually require more commitment, though, so you’ll need to look at some of these additional considerations: Monetary cost Some master’s degrees are quite costly. Opportunity cost If you’re taking master’s courses full time, would you have gone further in your career if you’d started working? You’d be giving up on work experience, work progression, and potential earnings. ROI Given the monetary and opportunity costs, is it worth it? When making big deci‐ sions like getting a master’s degree, you should estimate that the degree will return more in the long run than in the short term. If you’re interested in a master’s or higher degree only to boost your ML resume, then I recommend taking a course part time. Maybe your existing resume is enough, but you’re just missing some good side projects or interview practice. However, if there are other factors that make it worthwhile, such as intellectual curiosity, then go for it! To learn more, I recommend Eugene Yan’s reviewof his experience doing the part of his experience doing the parttime online master of science in computer science (OMSCS) degree at Georgia Tech. Now that I’ve covered project portfolios and credentials, here are some additional FAQs about resumes. I often hear the advice to keep tech resumes to one page. In general, I agree, and I personally keep my resume to one page. However, I can see this changing depending on your situation. I’ve interviewed many candidates from Europe who had two-page resumes, and they did fine going through the resume screening. In the United States and Canada, I tend to see candidates with one-page resumes. In tech in North America, it’s not custom to include profile pictures on a resume, but I have seen that when looking over the resumes of candidates from Asia and Europe. If you are job seeking in other parts of the world, double-check with people in the industry or even online forums to see if there are expectations for resume length or information to include that I haven’t lis‐ ted here. When I was in grad school, there was a type of resume called a CV (curriculum vitae). You use a CV to apply for graduate programs, postdoctorate programs, teaching positions in academia, and the like. A CV focuses more on your research publications and tends to be lengthier; it is rarely only one page long. Some CV formats I’ve seen use paragraphs more than the bullet-point format I see in industry. If you already have a CV, you can repurpose your research responsibilities into bullet points, condense them, and rework them as Of course, it’s probably fine if you just submit a CV directly as your resume, and I’ve seen candidates successfully get interviews without modifying their academic CVs, but investing a small amount of time could increase your EPA when applying to industry jobs. When I’m reading a resume, it’s not about the length but rather the quality of the pre‐ sented information. The first page and the top and center of the first page are what the interviewer will see first. You should put your most impressive and relevant expe‐ riences there. If you have other experiences you’d like to include, you can use the less important resume “real estate.” The question you should be answering is: if the per‐ son is screening a stack of 50 resumes, and they have only 5–10 seconds per resume, how can I make sure they see my most relevant experiences in those first 5–10 seconds?” As I mentioned in Chapter 1 , I don’t think there’s enough evidence that automatic filtering will reject your resume if you happen to have two columns or one column, or you use a certain font, or you use PDF versus Microsoft Word documents, and so on. Regardless, in this book, I’m assuming that automatic ATS rejections may be pos‐ sible. Personally, I’ve used two-column PDF resumes made with LaTeX for my entire career so far and haven’t had any issues at all, even with online job sites that automat‐ ically parse my resume into text. But if you think the formatting of your resume is the only thing keeping you from getting interviews, you might have bigger things to worry about. 11 First, let’s use the points from this chapter to see what else, apart from ATS filtering, might have kept your resume from being noticed: • Did you include the most important and ML/data-relevant information in the sections where a resume reviewer can quickly see it? • Do you have much relevant ML/data-relevant information on your resume? Have you made sure your resume includes keywords that overlap with those in the job descriptions? Are the bullet points on your resume clear? Are there typos or obvious errors on your resume? Use a resume checklist (listed earlier in the resume resources) to double-check. • Have you been trying referrals, tailoring your resume, or taking other actions that increase your EPA? That said, it is true that online forms will parse your resumes for text strings, so don’t send in a .png file or use avant-garde formatting and fonts (unless you’re applying for a niche design role, something that is beyond the scope of this book). Use a simple template linked in “Resume Resources” on page 43 or even from Google Docs and export it to a PDF. KISS (keep it simple, stupid) applies here. In summary, follow the instructions of the online application portal 12 and craft your resume using the best practices mentioned in this chapter.'},\n",

       "    'text': 'You’ve learned how to identify the ML roles best suited for you, and you’ve created a resume that’s relevant and tailored to the type of ML job you’re aiming for. My recommendation is to browse through some more job postings. When I browse for job postings, I learn a lot from simply reading job descriptions. For example, the types of “data scientist” roles I’m interested in could be very different from the “data scientist” roles that interest another job seeker. Recall the example where a “data sci‐ entist” in one company could be responsible for data analysis rather than training ML models. For the jobs with descriptions that do interest me, I note the requirements that they have in common. Optionally, I try to create two to three tailored resumes that I can send out en masse to roles that require similar skills. The reason I have two to three versions is because one is for job descriptions that seem to be looking for people who have more software skills, and another is for job descriptions for startups where I might emphasize my startup experience. The next step is to take an honest look at your current skills and the resume you’ve constructed for the ML role(s) you’re aiming for. When you were reading through ML job descriptions, in what ways did you think you could potentially strengthen your resume? What are keywords that showed up when you browsed job postings in “Exercise 2-4” on page 44 where you think you could learn more and add to your resume? Here’s a version of the ML skills matrix ( Table 1-3 ) but with blank spaces where you can evaluate your skills. Are you interested in model training but don’t have much knowledge in ML theory, statistics, or relevant programming tools? Are there other skills that you should boost in order to fit your target ML job? Fill in Table 2-4 , aided by the checklists that follow. In the table, rate your own skill levels: 1 being low and 3 being high. Table 2-4.

Note that this list is nonexhaustive and, depending on the job description, you may see more skills not listed here. Remember, you don’t have to get top marks in all sections since this depends on which area in the ML lifecycle that you’re interested in. However, this assessment should give you a good starting point. You should aim to get higher marks in the sections you’re interested in, or learn and prepare so that you have higher marks.This chapter focused on the ML job application step. This happens before you get interviews and is the key to getting interviews. You saw where to find jobs online and some ways to increase your chances of getting interviews via networking and refer‐ rals. You also read through some resume best practices, and hopefully, you have cre‐ ated an initial version of your resume. If you have it and feel ready, I encourage you to start applying for ML jobs even if you feel that your skills or your resume aren’t 100% perfect. Next, in the following chapters I’ll go through the various types of interviews, span‐ ning technical and behavioral interviews. First up are ML algorithms and theory, which are part of the technical interview.'}]},\n",

       "    'text': 'In Chapter 1 , you learned about the various steps you will go through as part of your ML interviews. In Chapter 2 , you looked at how to tie your experiences to roles of interest as well as how to craft a relevant resume. The goal of the previous chapters was to get you invited to interviews. In this chapter, I’ll focus on ML algorithms. As you recall, the interview process is illustrated in Figure 1-9 , and the ML algorithms interview is only one portion of the technical interviews; the rest, such as ML training and evaluation, coding, and so on, will be covered in subsequent chapters. You’re likely to be asked ML algorithm technical questions in an interview if you’re applying for any of the following jobs: • Data scientist who builds ML models • Machine learning engineer • Applied scientist • And similar roles Recall that within the common ML job titles ( Figure 1-8 ), there are some jobs that have the responsibility of training ML models in the ML lifecycle. This chapter focu‐ ses on assessing candidates for those skills; if the job you’re aiming for focuses less on training ML models, you might get a simplified version of this type of interview, or it might be skipped completely. This interview is meant to assess your understanding of ML algorithms, especially on the theoretical side. As to how you implement the algorithms with code, I cover that in the model deployment questions in Chapter 6 and the coding/programming tech‐ nical interview in Chapter 5 . The goal for you as an interviewee is for the interviewers to confirm that you understand the underlying concepts behind ML algorithms. Roles do exist where all you have to know is how to import the library with Python, but for more advanced projects, an underlying understanding can help you custom‐ ize various ML approaches and better debug and troubleshoot models. As covered in Chapter 1 , in the three pillars of ML roles, this is the pillar of ML algorithm and data intuition, which showcases your ability to adapt (refer to Figure 1-6 ). This skill is especially important in companies that have complex ML use cases and custom-made solutions, where you might modify or combine various off-the-shelf methods or cre‐ ate something from scratch. I try to mention as many common algorithms as space allows, but there are many more techniques under the sun. Be sure to check out the linked resources to extend your learning and interview preparation! It is also important to note that, in addition to understanding the ML algorithms’ inner workings and underlying statistical methods, you need to successfully commu‐ nicate that understanding to the interviewer. Yes, I know that communication skills have been brought up many times in this book, but they are what help set you apart as a successful candidate. As a rule of thumb, it’s important to be able to explain algorithms and ML concepts at two levels: on a simple “explain like I’m five years old” level and at a deeper, tech‐ nical level, one more appropriate for a college course. A second rule of thumb is to be prepared to answer follow-up questions to these ML algorithm interview questions. This is so the interviewer knows that you didn’t just memorize and then regurgitate the answer, but that you can apply it to various real-life scenarios on the job. In this chapter, I break down technical questions on the following topics so you can easily refer to a specific question if your interview focuses on that topic: • Statistical techniques • Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning • Natural language processing (NLP) • Recommender systems • Reinforcement learning • Computer vision In technical interviews that are very structured, such as the Ama‐ zon data science initial phone screen, they will ask you clearly scoped questions, such as asking for a definition of a particular algorithm. After you answer, they will generally move on without additional follow-up questions. There are companies that mix structured questions with a free-form discussion, where the inter‐ viewer might dig deeper into your answer, and the conversation might branch out from there into your past experiences.'},\n",
       "   {'section': 'Statistical and Foundational Techniques',\n",
       "    'text': 'Statistical techniques are used in every data role, and these techniques are the foun‐ dations for ML projects. Hence, in ML interviews, you will most likely have questions that cover this topic. 1 Statistical techniques help build baseline models to compare more costly models and algorithms against or help discover if there is enough mean‐ ingful data in the first place to build ML models. For the purposes of this book, I will be placing the foundational regression tech‐ niques in this section, as well as various techniques for training and improving ML models. In short, these are (1) foundational techniques and (2) methods used during model training, such as training splits, regularization, and so on. These concepts are foundational knowledge for any type of ML algorithms that will be mentioned later as well as foundations for ML interview questions. This section covers the basics of statistical techniques for those who are unsure whether they have sufficient background knowledge in this area. Feel free to skip the subsections if you already have expertise in any of these areas. Regardless of your expertise, I’ve highlighted specific advice for ML interviews in the tip boxes to help you apply your knowledge of each ML area and excel in your interviews. To further supplement your knowledge on statistical and foundational techniques beyond the summaries I’ve provided in this book, I recommend the following resources: • The Elements of Statistical Learning by Trevor Hastie et al. • An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python by Gareth James et al. • Courses on Coursera by DeepLearning.AI and Andrew Ng; this resource is also useful for all following subtopics of ML (I won’t repeatedly link their courses— since they sometimes change and update—in the following sections). • Introduction to Machine Learning Interviews by Chip Huyen has additional questions for overall ML interviews which can be referenced for most sections in this chapter. Refer back to this section for reference material when preparing for interviews. Now, let’s jump in. Here’s an overview of one of the foundations of ML algorithms—variables—and a simple example of fitting a model. Let’s say that you have a dataset about apples, with the weight and height of each apple. You also have a list of past sales prices of each apple. With the list of apple weights, heights, and past sales prices, you want to guess the sales price of new apples, before they are sold. For the sake of this example, ignore big grocery chains automati‐ cally calculating a price, but let’s say you’re selling as a hobby to friends and family, or maybe you’re running a farm that a grandparent left you. So you are making use of the weight and height of each single new apple to predict its price. Weight and height are fixed observations at that point in time (an apple can’t be both 100 grams and 150 grams at the same time). Now, to connect all these concepts, let’s add in some terminology. Variables refer to everything that is being taken into account in your model of how apple prices are cal‐ culated. So the variables in this case include weight, height, and price. Within these variables, you know the weight and height of each new apple, and they are fixed at that point in time. So the weight and height are independent variables. Then, you have another variable, price, that you’d like to predict for new apples prior to know‐ ing the correct answer before selling them. The predicted price depends on the height and weight of the new apple. For example, heavier and taller apples sell for more money. Thus, price is a dependent variable (shown in Table 3-1 ). Table 3-1. Examples of independent and dependent variables The concepts of independent and dependent variables are tried and true, but the ter‐ minology might not be. In different fields, you may have come across the terms listed in Table 3-2 , although they may differ from industry to industry or from textbook to textbook. During your interview, make sure you and the interviewer aren’t crossing wires due to terminology, and double-check with your interviewer if you sense that you’re using a different term to refer to the same thing. Knowing the most common terms can help you use them appropriately in your interviews in various fields. Table 3-2. Synonyms of independent and dependent variables Models are a way of using past data points to describe “the way the world works,” or, in other words, a way of finding patterns and connections with past information. The apples example from the previous section uses a model that describes the way pricing works. The model is something that knows the “truth”—even if it’s not the full truth but rather our best attempt to approximate the truth. Thus, the model can be used to predict our best approximation of future data points. This applies for all “models” in ML models. Recommender-system models seek to predict what a user will like or click on when visiting a website. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition “learn” a model of what various pixels represent: is this cluster and layout of pixels a cat or a dog? Just as for independent and dependent variables, it is important to have a shared defi‐ nition for “model” to prevent miscommunication during an interview, such as con‐ fusing algorithms with models. 2 The model is the outcome of having run and fit an ML algorithm. I wanted to make sure I included regression models. I’m glad that I learned the detailed ins and outs of linear and logistic regression, even calculating them by hand (a requirement for the second-year statistics course I was taking as part of an eco‐ nomics major at university). This knowledge has compounded and helped me under‐ stand the new ML algorithms I’ve encountered as well as how to apply them in practice. All of my learning stemmed from understanding these entry-level concepts, so I highly recommend not shying away from learning the mathematics of regression models. Again, feel free to skip this section if you already have expertise in this area. Let’s use the apple example from an earlier section in a graph. For simplicity and to squeeze it onto a two-dimensional graph, let’s use just one independent variable, weight , to predict the dependent variable, price . Each dot on the graph in Figure 3-1 represents a data point from past sales, so you already know the sale prices for them. For example, the dot with a callout on the graph weighs 80 grams (its intersect on the x-axis) and sold for $1 (its intersect on the y-axis). Note that this is a simple example; most usage of linear regression will have multiple independent variables (“multivaria‐ ble”) and if visualized, will be a line in an N -dimensional space, where N = number of variables + 1 (when there is one output variable). In addition, this example has one dependent variable; when there are multiple dependent/output variables, the regres‐ sion task is referred to as being multivariate . Note that multivariate is separate from the “multivariable” concept mentioned earlier. Figure 3-1. Data points to be used for linear regression. The next step in linear regression is fitting the titular “line” to the data points. Behind the scenes, software tools like Python, Stata, IBM SPSS, SAS, MATLAB, and the like will calculate a “line of best fit.” According to the definition of a model given previ‐ ously in this section, this line is the model , which is the best approximation of the truth with the data points that you have. Starting with an initial line, the software will calculate the residual : the y-axis distance between a data point and the line, as illus‐ trated in Figure 3-2 . Colloquially, the residual is also referred to as the residual error . Figure 3-2. Fitting the line of best fit in linear regression; the line is iterated on until the residuals are as small as possible. All the residuals are squared so that predictions above and the line don’t cancel each other out due to having opposite signs (positive, negative). The goal is that the sum of the residuals is as small as possible since if you have a line that is drastically far away from the data points, that means the line isn’t fitting well to as many data points as possible and as correctly as possible. Mathematically, a common technique to tell how well the line is fitting is the process called least squares . Achieving least squares means finding the line that results in the smallest sum of squared residuals, which in turn means you have the “line of best fit”: the line is fitting the data points with least distance from the data points overall, as shown in Figure 3-3 . Figure 3-3. Least squares and terminology; y represents observed data points, and ŷ (y Figure 3-3. Least squares and terminology; y represents observed data points, and ŷ (yhat) represents the predicted/estimated values. The end result is a line that has the smallest sum of least squares to the data points, as illustrated in Figure 3-4 . Figure 3-4. The resulting line of best fit with least squares from the data in Figure 3-1 . Going forward, you can use this “line of best fit” as a model to predict new apple pri‐ ces! You can plug the apple weight into the line (in equation form) to get a numerical value for the predicted price. This is one of the most basic ways of calculating a model from data points, but it has the same pattern as more in-depth ML models and algo‐ rithms that are covered in the next chapter. Namely, you’ll initialize a line (you don’t know if this is the best model yet) and calculate the residuals, or how well it fits. Next, you’ll change the line by tilting it a little—mathematically, this is called updating coef‐ ficients or weights— and calculate the residuals again, as illustrated in Figure 3-2 . This updating process is called training , which is where the commonly used phrase “training/to train an ML model” comes from. If the sum of the squared residuals is getting smaller, then you are on the right track. When you can’t make the squared residuals any smaller, you’ve achieved least squares, and that’s how you can say the line is your best approximation with this dataset (as illustrated in Figure 3-4 ). It’s like that game where there’s an item hidden in the room, and as you walk around the room trying to find it, your friend says “hot” if you’re getting closer and “cold” when you’re walking farther away. You want to walk toward hotter and hotter areas in the room, until you reach the final position. In Chapter 4 , I’ll walk through ways to evaluate models via error terms such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and more, which are very sim‐ ilar concepts to residuals. The main difference here is that residuals are the difference between past observation data and model estimations while errors are the difference between model estimations and actual data previously unseen by the model. In other words, errors are the differences after applying the model to previously unseen data in order to evaluate model performance. To sum up, when using supervised 3 machine learning such as the simple linear regression example in the previous section, you’ll generally start with a dataset and want the ML algorithm to learn a model of how things work. You then will use the model to calculate the values of dependent variables, such as predicting how much apples will sell for before they are actually sold. In other words, you have a dataset of past data points and, of course, no future data points. When the ML model is being trained, it’s learning to “fit” the data that you currently have. There are some issues that could arise with model training when the model is used in the real world. For one, there will always be outliers or changing events in the real world. One example is in financial predictions with ML: the market could swing suddenly to a bear (downturn) market, and the model we’ve trained with financial data in a bull (upswing) market will produce horrible and wildly inaccurate predictions. Another example is that the dataset you have isn’t representative enough of the behaviors of the real world. In the apples example from the previous section, you assume that with the weight and height data of the apples, you can predict the sell price of new apples. But what if the data you have on hand isn’t enough, and apple variants like Fuji or Honeycrisp (one of my favorites) sell for more? You didn’t have each apple’s variant name tracked in your dataset, so then your model may be incorrect once you put it to the test. But for now, you have only the current dataset. To make the most of it, you need to keep some of the data you have for testing purposes. What this means is that you can break out 80% of the apple data points to use for model training and then save 20% of the apple data points to run the trained model predictions on. The 80% the model is trained on is called the training set (sometimes referred to as the train set ), and the 20% of data that is unseen by the model during the training phase is called the test set . This mimics the real-world scenario of running the model to predict new data points; the test set serves that purpose. In many cases, you might even split the data into three chunks: 80% as the training dataset, 10% as the validation (holdout) dataset, and another 10% as the test dataset ( Figure 3-5 ). The validation set allows you to monitor the model’s performance during the train‐ ing process without “formally” evaluating it, and it enables you to diagnose weak spots of the model and tune its parameters. The test set, as previously mentioned, was unseen by the model during the training process and thus is used to formally evaluate the model performance, mimicking a real-world environment as much as possible. Of course, having a test and validation set isn’t infallible, which brings us to more robust techniques and the concepts of model overfitting and underfitting. Figure 3-5. Training, validation, and test set splits. For interview questions on training and test sets, make sure you can name common ways to augment the simpler splits, such as using cross-validation : 4 splitting up data into smaller chunks and rotating through them as training sets. There are many reasons a model may not perform well on real-world data (or even the validation or test set). A common starting point is addressing overfitting or underfitting. Underfitting is when the model isn’t fitting well. This might mean that the model isn’t able to capture the relationship between the dataset’s independent variables (e.g., weight, height, etc.) and the dependent variables (e.g., price). Conse‐ quently, some ways to reduce underfitting are related to helping the model learn more nuances or patterns during the training process. For example, adding more variables, or model features, such as apple variant or age of the apple, could help the model learn more patterns from the training data and potentially reduce underfitting. A second way to reduce underfitting is to increase the Overfitting is when a model fits the training data too closely and very specifically, perhaps finding patterns that happen to be in the training set but not elsewhere. A simplified example is that the training data just so happens to have a lot of apples that are disproportionately expensive despite their weight (e.g., Sekai Ichi apples 6 ). The model learned from that data and overfit to it, therefore making incorrect predictions that are overpriced for cheaper apple variants. Simply put, the model is overmemo‐ rizing the training data and unable to generalize to new data points. There are many techniques to make the model generalize better, such as adding more training data, data augmentation, or regularization. 7 I’ll cover the details of regularization next. Regularization is a technique used to reduce overfitting of ML models. Generally, regularization will create a damper on model weights/coefficient. By this point, you likely know what I’m going to do—which is to bring up the apples again! Apples are my favorite fruit, which is probably why I use the example so often. So let’s say the model has learned to weigh “weight of apple” more heavily (accidental pun, but model “weights” is legitimate terminology); then the weight of the apple is mathe‐ matically increasing the results of the ML model’s prediction of the price by a rela‐ tively high positive value. If you can dampen the amount by which the weight of the apple increases the model’s predictions of the price, via regularization, that can make the model generalize more and take other variables into account more evenly. The variance bias trade-off is a common topic in ML interviews. When applying ML model improvement techniques such as regularization, it is important to consider the trade-off between fixing for bias versus variance. Bias refers to the overall inaccuracy of the model and can often be caused by an oversimplified (underfit) model. Variance comes from overfitting, when the model has learned too specifically from the training set. One way to remember why this is called “variance” is that the term refers to the variability of the model: the model is overfit to specific points or traits, so the model is very sensitive to different data points, causing fluctuation and variability. Regularization might cause a model to reduce its variance but might inadvertently increase bias, so that’s a reason to be cautious and test various model-improvement techniques. Now that I’ve covered various statistical and ML techniques at a higher level, let’s look at some sample questions. Here, I will dive into the details of common interview questions that stem from the concepts covered in this section. These details may not have been previously addressed, so my hope is that these sample questions also serve to explain the new concepts. Example answer L1 regularization , also known as lasso regularization , 8 is a type of regularization that shrinks model parameters toward zero. L2 regularization (also known as ridge regularization ) adds a penalty term to the objective function that is propor‐ tional to the square of the coefficients of the model. This penalty term shrinks the coefficients toward zero, but unlike L1 (lasso) regularization, it does not make any of the coefficients exactly equal to zero. L2 regularization can help reduce overfitting and improve the stability of the model by keeping coefficients from becoming too large. Both L1 and L2 regulari‐ zation are commonly used to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of ML models. Interview questions on model overfitting and underfitting may lead to follow-up questions. For example, if you bring up L1 and L2 regularization, the interviewer might ask, “What other types of reg‐ ularization could work?” In that case, you could bring up elastic net , which is a combination of L1 and L2 techniques. Or for the overfitting case, ensemble techniques can also help (refer to “Inter‐ view question 3-3: Explain boosting and bagging and what they can help with.” on page 76 ). Example answer Imbalanced datasets in ML refer to datasets in which some classes or categories outweigh others. 9 Techniques to deal with imbalanced datasets include data aug‐ mentation, oversampling, undersampling, ensemble methods, and so on: Data augmentation Data augmentation involves generating more examples for the ML model to train on, such as rotating images so that the dataset includes images of humans turned upside down as well as the normal upright image orienta‐ tion. Without data augmentation, the model might not be able to correctly recognize images of humans who are laying sideways or doing headstands since the data is imbalanced toward humans in an upright pose. Oversampling Oversampling is a technique to increase the number of data points of a minority class via synthetic generation. As an example, SMOTE (synthetic minority oversampling technique) 10 uses the feature vectors of the minority classes to generate synthetic data points that are located between real data points and their k-nearest neighbors. This could synthetically increase the size of the minority class(es) and improve the performance of the ML model trained on a dataset with oversampling treatment. Undersampling Undersampling does the opposite: it reduces examples from the majority class to balance the number of data points of the majority class and minority class(es). Oversampling is generally preferred in practice since undersam‐ pling may cause useful data to be discarded, which is exacerbated when the dataset is already small. Ensemble methods Ensemble methods can also be used to increase model performance when dealing with an imbalanced dataset. 11 Each model in the ensemble can be trained on a different subset of the data and can help learn the nuances of each class better. When answering ML interview questions, take a second to confirm the scope of the question. In other words, if the question is asking only for a definition of logistic regression, don’t go on a tangent about various other techniques. If the question is open-ended, you can confirm whether the interviewer is asking for something specific. Example answer Bagging and boosting are ensemble techniques used to improve the performance of ML models: Bagging Bagging trains multiple models on different subsets of the training data and combines their predictions to make a final prediction. Boosting Boosting trains a series of models where each model tries to correct the mis‐ takes made by the previous model. The final prediction is made by all the models. Ensemble techniques can help with a variety of issues encountered during ML training. For example, they can help with imbalanced data 12 and See Chapter 4 for more in-depth questions concerning model evaluation.'},\n",

       "    'text': 'In ML roles, knowing when and what to pick from each family of techniques— including supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning—is an essential skill. In my previous jobs, I’ve used supervised learning to prevent fraud and customer churn, but at other times, I used unsupervised learning like anomaly detection for the same problem, depending on the data and situation. Sometimes (more often, as you grow more senior in your ML career), you might even create an ML pipeline with both supervised and unsupervised learning. In your reinforcement learning pipeline, you might use supervised learning in a previous step to label features. Understanding the underlying mechanics can help you adapt to new situations when using different techniques might be more effective than sticking to what is convenient. Therefore, in interviews there are often questions about supervised versus unsuper‐ vised learning. Reinforcement learning (RL) is considered a somewhat advanced topic and may not be touched on in many interviews. However, I’ve been asked about it in a nontrivial number of interviews because of the growth of RL use for industry applications such as in conjunction with recommender systems—although my past work experience in RL may have prompted the interviewers to ask me about it. As I mentioned in Chapter 2 , if something’s on your resume, it’s fair game to discuss in the interview! For a more comprehensive overview of RL, see “Reinforcement Learn‐ ing Algorithms” on page 101 . Regardless of what types of ML roles you’re interviewing for, knowledge about supervised and unsupervised learning is a must. Brush up on reinforcement learning concepts afterward, in terms of priority. This section covers the basics of labeled data, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi- and self-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning, those who are unsure whether they have the background knowledge in this area. Feel free to skip the subsections if you already have expertise in any of these areas. Regardless of your expertise, I’ve highlighted specific advice for ML interviews in the tip boxes to help you apply your knowledge of each ML area and excel in your interviews. To further supplement your knowledge on supervised and unsupervised ML tech‐ niques, beyond the summaries I’ve provided in this book, I recommend the following resource: • The Elements of Statistical Learning by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jer‐ ome Friedman Refer back to this section for reference material when preparing for interviews. Returning to our apple dataset from “Summarizing Independent and Dependent Variables,” you have the data points for how much apples sold for in the past. The price is also the dependent variable in “Summarizing Linear Regression.” The fact that you do have labels for the dataset 14 means that the ML tasks you were doing pre‐ viously were with labeled data. An example of unlabeled data is when you have the prices and weights of the apples but not the apple variants, yet you try to deduce commonalities within different variants of apples. Because you don’t initially have the correct or expected “label”—in this case, the apple variant—you would be using unla‐ beled data and conducting unsupervised learning. Building on the concept of labeled and unlabeled data, let’s move on to supervised learning. Supervised learning is the first type of machine learning as defined by its use of labeled data, illustrated in Figure 3-6 . Supervised learning uses correct or expected outcomes of the past to predict the dependent variables for new or future data points. The example of using apple weight, variant, and so on to predict sales prices for new apples is supervised learning. Supervised learning can be broken down into two main categories: regression and classification. Figure 3-6. Overview of machine learning families (simplified for understanding). In regression tasks, the dependent/output variable is a continuous value. For example, predicting stock prices, housing prices, or weather (temperature) produces continu‐ ous values. Classification is a type of supervised learning in which the dependent/ output variable is categorical—that is, it is put into a category, such as “it’s a dog” or “it’s a cat.” Classification examples include detecting whether something is or isn’t spam, using image recognition such as tagging animal types in a picture, and so on. It is possible to mix categorical data with continuous data via techniques such asone onehot encoding . For example, if we’re trying to classify if there is a dog or a cat in an image, an image that has a dog will be encoded with 1 for the “dog” category and 0 for the “cat” category. Think of it like a Boolean (True/False) representation of the data for each category. Then you can mix these numerical encodings (0 or 1) with datasets with continuous values. Unsupervised learning is training a model with unlabeled data: when you do not have the “labels” available (the labels being the correct or expected values that you are looking for). You’d likely use unsupervised learning to find patterns, commonalities, or anomalies in the dataset without prior knowledge in the ML model of correct or expected result labels. Common usage of unsupervised learning includes clustering and dimensionality reduction (see Figure 3-6 ). Many generative models are unsupervised, such as varia‐ tional autoencoder (VAE), which is used with applications like Stable Diffusion for image generation. Clustering is an ML task that groups similar data points together into clusters, as illustrated in Figure 3-7 , which allows you to see any emerging patterns. While you won’t be able to deduce any labels that you don’t have, you can still find outliers or clusters of interest to further investigate. Unsupervised learning can be used for cus‐ tomer segmentation because you can hypothesize that customers in the same clusters might have similar preferences or behaviors. You can use unsupervised learning for anomaly and outlier detection since you can find abnormal patterns in the data without prior knowledge of what an “anomaly” looks like. Figure 3-7. Example of unsupervised learning: clustering. Dimensionality reduction is a common technique used to reduce the number of redundant input variables in training data. Reducing the number of features/input variables can help to reduce overfitting since models that learn from too many vari‐ ables might also learn from the “noise” from those variables. Additional variations as extensions of supervised and unsupervised learning have become more popular in the industry, especially because of limitations on fully label‐ ing large amounts of data. You might not encounter these concepts much during interviews, but you should be aware of them. If the team you’re interviewing with uses these techniques, it will be good to be prepared to discuss them. Semisupervised learning uses a small amount of labeled data (usually manually labeled) to train a separate ML model specifically meant to help with machine label‐ ing previously unlabeled data. The initial labeled dataset is then combined with the machine-generated labels with highest confidence to create a larger labeled dataset, as illustrated in Figure 3-8 . Figure 3-8. Semisupervised learning overview. Self-supervised learning 15 relies on the dataset itself to learn latent representations, without labels. For example, in an image, if certain parts are removed, can we predict or generate those missing parts? Common usage of self-supervised learning includes filling in missing parts of images, audio, video, 16 text, and so on. Semisupervised and self-supervised learning can be brought up in interview answers to help with a lack of labeled data or cases where it’s not necessary to label all the data. The third major type of machine learning based on the dataset or the usage of labels is reinforcement learning (RL). In it’s simplest form, RL doesn’t necessarily require a prior dataset, although generally in industry, I’d still prefer to have some existing dataset or existing model so I can test the RL algorithms offline (not live) before deploying the RL agent into the real world or into the hands of customers. RL relies on an “agent,” which is not the same as the concept of an ML “model” that I introduced earlier, although they do have similarities in that they both improve and learn through iterations. RL learns through trial and error. The agent only needs to react to each new data point as it comes in, and the agent eventually learns enough from experience to figure out an optimal way of predicting the best action to carry out next. A common RL example is a robot learning to navigate a maze that has rewards, traps, and an exit (for an example, see Figure 3-14 later in this chapter). The first time the robot moves through the maze, it has no knowledge of where the gold, traps, and exit are. But as it encounters those things in the environment, it also acquires knowledge, or data points, about the past, similar to constructing its own dataset via trial and error. After the robot has navigated the maze enough times, it learns the fastest and safest path to the exit. But based on how you design the RL agent, it can also optimize for various goals, such as collecting the most gold instead of reaching the exit as fast as possible. There are various types of RL, some of which resemble supervised learning, but I will leave the in-depth discussion of those for the section “Reinforcement Learning Algo‐ rithms” on page 101 . RL is commonly used in gaming, robotics, and self-driving cars, but RL can also be used for a growing number of applications that previously used supervised learning, such as a system that recommends videos on YouTube. Now that I’ve covered supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning at a higher level, let’s look at some common interview questions that stem from these concepts. This section specifically covers interview questions on supervised and unsupervised learning; since RL has its own section, “Rein‐ forcement Learning Algorithms” on page 101 , the questions on RL can be found there. Example answer The regression family of algorithms includes linear regression and logistic regres‐ sion, among other algorithms such as generalized linear models (GLMs) and var‐ ious time-series regression models such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). The decision tree family of algorithms can be used for both classification and regression tasks within supervised learning; these include XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and so on. Decision trees can be combined in random forest algo‐ rithms, which ensemble (combine) a multitude of decision trees. Like decision trees, random forests can be used for both classification and regression tasks under supervised learning. Neural networks can be used for supervised learning tasks as well as unsupervised learning. In terms of supervised learning, these include many tasks in this sec‐ tion, such as image classification, object detection, speech recognition, and natu‐ ral language processing (NLP). Other algorithms include naive Bayes, 17 which is a supervised classification algorithm that uses Bayes’ theorem . 18 Applications of Bayes’ theorem in ML include Bayesian neural networks, 19 which predict a distribution of results (for example, a normal model might predict the price is $100, but the Bayesian model will predict the price is $100 with a standard deviation of 5). Example answer Unsupervised learning is commonly used for clustering, anomaly detection, and dimensionality reduction. I’ll group the algorithms by those categories. Cluster‐ ing is often done with algorithms such as k-means clustering and density-based clustering (DBSCAN algorithm). K-means clustering groups the data into k clusters, and the algorithm iteratively labels each data point with the cluster’s centroid. The cluster centroid is then updated, and the algorithm continues until the cluster assignments have reached a stable state and no longer shift or change. DBSCAN is a popular algorithm that groups together data points that are close to one another (high density) and also separates those clusters from one another depending on their distance. Because unsupervised learning algorithms can han‐ dle large class imbalances, there are common unsupervised learning algorithms that address anomaly detections. There are many algorithms that can be used for dimensionality reduction. Princi‐ pal component analysis (PCA) can “flatten” datasets into a lower-dimensional space. This is useful for data preprocessing since it can reduce the number of redundant features that are used while keeping the variance in the data so that enough signals and patterns are preserved in the data. Autoencoders are a type of unsupervised learning with a broad range of applica‐ tions, notably in NLP—but not limited to NLP. They can be used to encode a compressed representation of input text, which is also a form of dimensionality reduction, and then decode the compressed representation for the generation of the next chunk of text data. This is useful for text completion and text summari‐ zation tasks. As a subset of unsupervised learning, self-supervised learning is also a case where autoencoders can be used. Examples include self-supervised learn‐ Example answer The major difference between the two types of machine learning is related to the training data that is used. Supervised learning uses labeled data while unsuper‐ vised learning uses unlabeled data. Labeled data refers to the correct output or result from the ML model already being inside the training dataset. Supervised and unsupervised learning also differ in terms of the ML model out‐ puts. In supervised learning, the ML model aims to predict what the label would be. Unsupervised learning doesn’t predict specific label(s) but rather tries to find latent patterns and groupings within the dataset, which can be used to cluster new data points. In terms of evaluation, the two types of ML are assessed differently. Supervised learning is evaluated by comparing its outputs with the correct output (with the test/holdout/validation datasets). In unsupervised learning, the model is evalu‐ ated based on how well it groups or captures patterns within the data, via metrics such as the Jaccard score or silhouette index for clustering and receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC)/area under the curve (AUC) metrics for positive rate Finally, supervised learning and unsupervised learning are generally used for different types of tasks. Supervised learning is often used for classification (pre‐ dicting the correct category) or regression (predicting the correct value) tasks while unsupervised learning is often used for clustering, anomaly detection, and dimensionality reduction tasks. Example answer Unsupervised learning and supervised learning differ in the usage of results or labels. Hence, unsupervised learning is most suitable for cases where labeled data is not available or when the task isn’t to predict a “correct” output, but rather to find patterns or anomalies in the data. As a real-world example, supervised learning can be used for classification and object detection, such as in image recognition tasks. In the training dataset I’ll have the correct objects labeled, and the algorithms will then know if they’re learning to detect objects correctly based on comparing their predictions with the ground truth. In other words, if the algorithm isn’t correctly boxing faces in images, I’d know since I’ll have each image (with the faces correctly boxed) to compare to. Other scenarios for supervised learning could include predicting the price of a rare trading card based on its features, such as its age, its series name, and the condition of the card. Given that I have a dataset with fraudulent data already correctly labeled, fraud detection could also be an application of super‐ vised learning. If I didn’t already have labeled data about fraudulent behavior, I might opt to use unsupervised learning instead, via detecting anomalous behaviors. In a real interview, you might not have to come up with so many examples, but as a reference answer, I’m including a few. It’s even better if you can come up with an example that’s a common con‐ cern for the industry of the company where you’re interviewing. For example, time-series examples are often relevant to finance and fintech industries, and fraud detection is relevant to online sales platforms, banking, and finance. Sometimes unsupervised learning is more suitable than supervised learning. For gen‐ eral warning signs of abnormal behavior, anomaly detection can be used to find an anomalous login location for a user’s online bank account. Clustering is an unsuper‐ vised learning task, and a real-world application could be to group customers into segments based on their features (e.g., behavior, preferences), something that busi‐ nesses might use to identify how they can tailor products to users in a cluster or to target marketing campaigns. If I investigate a cluster and it shows that young professionals have similar behaviors via the clustering algorithm, then we might know that we can give them similar promotional materials in the company’s next dig‐ ital ad campaign. Example answer One common problem that can affect supervised learning is the lack of labeled data. For example, when I want to classify specific cartoon and anime characters in images with ML, I don’t have labeled data available on the internet to down‐ load and use. There are open source datasets such as CIFAR, 22 which are labeled for general objects and items, but when it comes to more specific use cases, I would have to acquire and label images myself (for personal usage). I had to address the issue of not having enough labeled data; in this case, hand labeling a few examples worked as a starting point. However, there still weren’t enough labeled examples, which resulted in an imbalanced dataset. To artificially increase the amount of labeled data, I used data augmentation, creating synthetic data and variations on existing data to make the ML model more robust. An example of data augmentation in image recognition is to randomly flip or rotate images. To illustrate why this can increase samples, if I flip one upright anime character looking to the right, it becomes two data points for the model to learn from: one looking right and one looking left. Rotation can also help: can the ML algorithm correctly identify anime characters who are leaning sideways or who are even upside down, doing a headstand? Another tip is to tie techniques that you’ve used to your past experience (so you can answer the interviewer’s follow-up questions more easily) or to scenarios that you know would be relevant to the employer’s industry, as mentioned before.'},\n",

       "    'text': 'NLP has gained traction in recent years, with the notable example of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. There are a lot of interview questions that build off the foundational tech‐ niques of transformers, and subsequently the BERT and GPT families of models, so I will cover those concepts in this section. NLP is often applied in chatbots and sentiment analysis (for example, to see if the general attitude toward a product or company is positive or negative, based on Reddit or Twitter posts) as well as to generate written content. If you are interviewing for a company or team that is working on NLP, you will definitely be asked to demon‐ strate your understanding of these concepts in depth. Even if you’re not interviewing for an NLP team specifically, I’d still recommend having a general understanding of NLP applications, which will make you a more well-rounded candidate and ML pro‐ fessional. Not to mention, NLP techniques are no longer used to generate written content only; they are also being combined with computer vision, text-to-image models to generate images, video, audio, and so on. Even time-series prediction and recommender systems have started picking up NLP techniques. You’ll benefit from learning the basics of NLP because of how generalizable the techniques are. This section covers the basics of NLP techniques for those who are unsure whether they have the background knowledge in this area. Feel free to skip the subsections if you already have expertise in any of these areas. Regardless of your expertise, I’ve highlighted specific advice for ML interviews in the tip boxes to help you apply your knowledge of each ML area and excel in your interviews. To further supplement your knowledge of NLP techniques beyond the summaries I’ve provided in this book, I recommend the following resources: • Generative Deep Learning by David Foster (O’Reilly) • Natural Language Processing with Transformers by Lewis Tunstall, Leandro von Werra, and Thomas Wolf (O’Reilly) • The Practical Guides for Large Language Models on GitHub • Practical Natural Language Processing by Sowmya Vajjala, Bodhisattwa Majumder, Anuj Gupta, and Harshit Surana (O’Reilly) Refer back to this section for reference material when preparing for interviews. Let’s break down the components that power NLP. First, you have a dataset, often called a text corpus . 23 A text corpus can consist of many types of text, such as news, online forums, or anything with a lot of authentic and meaningful text that isn’t gibberish. Next, with this dataset you’ll need to preprocess the data much like you would for other ML jobs. Some common techniques that are quizzed about in inter‐ views are tokenization, bag of words, or TF-IDF (term frequency–inverse document frequency). Tokenization is the process of breaking down the text into individual words, phrases, or useful semantic units. 24 For example, depending on the situation, the word “pre‐ process” could be left as its own token or separated into “pre” and “process.” “Aren’t” could be left as its own token but could also be separated into “are,” and “n’t.” Once the dataset has been preprocessed, language modeling can be formulated to predict the next sequence of items, which could be the next word (as illustrated in Figure 3-9 ), the next sentence, the next paragraph, missing words, and so on. Figure 3-9. Next word or phrase prediction, as seen in autocomplete on phones or Bag of words ( BoW ) is a way to map a sentence or phrase by mapping the words in it to a vector. The vector can consist of the words and other info, such as how many times the word has appeared (1 if once, 2 if twice, and so on). An example .json representation for the sentence “Syd likes to drink bubble tea and chamomile tea” would be: Note that the word “tea” appears twice, and thus the count is 2. TF-IDF uses the frequency of the appearance of words in a passage or document to determine how relevant those words are. Although it shares many foundational concepts with other types of ML, NLP comes with unique challenges. In cases where supervised learning is used, such as down‐ stream fine-tuning, the data is hard to label. For example, if you are using supervised fine-tuning for sentiment analysis to quickly predict if a user review is positive or negative, it can be ambiguous at times. Another challenge is that there’s a large amount of variability, such as slang and regional syntax differences, which can also lead to data sparsity, where exact combinations of words might rarely appear in the text corpus but are still valid. Common use cases of NLP include sentiment analysis, chatbots, text classification (e.g., spam versus not spam), text generation, text summarization, text-to-image gen‐ eration, and many more. BoW and TF-IDF are useful underlying techniques that I’ve recently heard mentioned in interviews. Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network designed to handle long sequences of data, which is useful in NLP applications. Like attention units in transformers, long-term dependencies and context of prior text are important for NLP to be effective. However, LSTMs have some limitations, such as when dealing with very long sequences of text—that is, understanding the context of text that came much earlier in a page or paragraph. To that end, transformers (cov‐ ered in the next section) are able to handle long-term dependencies better. LSTMs can be used for feature engineering and time series as well. I don’t include more explanation here because of space constraints, but I encourage you to read more. Christopher Olah’s blog Under‐ standing LSTM Networks offers a good series of illustrations for understanding how LSTMs are used. The transformer model was introduced by Google in 2017, 26 which has enabled a larger scope of language models in recent years. Transformers are effective at NLP modeling because of their improvements in handling context and meaning over longer text strings compared to existing architectures like convolutional neural net‐ works (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). 27 Transformers are also better suited to finding patterns within the dataset, as opposed to requiring large, labeled datasets like CNNs and RNNs do. Hence, there is a lower barrier to entry for what datasets are available. With transformers, large, free-form text corpora from the internet became available for use, without the need for costly labeling beforehand. Attention units within the transformer network are part of transformers’ effective‐ ness and can find both short- and long-distance relationships between words, which helps the model correctly label the context. Take, for example, the sentences “Max went to the record store. Later, he bought a Jay Chou album.” Self-attention units can correctly identify that “ he ” is referring to “Max.” Combined with BERT’s encoder architecture and multihead attention mechanisms, this has resulted in significant improvements in the performance and capabilities of NLP tasks. Developed by Google, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Trans‐ formers) models have been used to process queries on the Google search engine since 2019. 28 As hinted at in its full name, BERT makes use of the transformer neutral net‐ work discussed earlier. BERT is pretrained, meaning the initial training step done by Google generates the model that users can access 29 via “self-supervised” learning on a large corpus of text, such as Wikipedia and other text datasets. There are two tasks BERT is trained on during pretraining: masked language modeling (MLM) and next sentence prediction (NSP). Masked language modeling refers to randomly “masking,” or blocking/removing, sev‐ eral tokens in a sentence and letting the model learn to correctly predict those tokens—for example, “Lisa is singing a [MASK],” where [MASK] signifies the token for BERT to predict. This is illustrated in Figure 3-10 . If BERT can predict that “song” or “melody” or other words have a higher probability of being correct, then the model training is going well. If it’s predicting words or tokens like “dog,” then it is not being accurate at that point during model training. Figure 3-10. Illustration of masked language modeling. Next sentence prediction is the second task that BERT is trained on. The goal is to accurately predict the next sentence in a text sequence. Since this training process can provide feedback to the model without external labeling, it is not “supervised” learning per se, but it is described as “self-supervised” since the feedback comes from the text corpus itself. After model pretraining, users can then download the model or use an API 30 to “fine-tune” the model to their own use cases. This improves on the user’s copy of the BERT model and requires supervised learning. For example, the user may wish to use BERT for sentiment analysis; in that case, the user would need to provide examples and labels of text that have a positive sentiment, negative sentiment, or ambiguous sentiment (if the user wishes). If you want to use BERT to generate text with a spe‐ cific tone—for example, a movie supervillain—you’d need to provide BERT-specific examples as part of fine-tuning. BERT saves the user a lot of time on tasks like these since it already has a general understanding of the target language (English, among pretrained models of other languages that have been created by various developers 31 ). Fine-tuning can be used for many other ML models, not just BERT. For example, you can fine-tune models such as GPT-3.5 (at the time of writing). However, I include fine-tuning under BERT since I have seen many interviews ask about fine-tuning in the con‐ text of BERT. The GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) family of NLP models is known for powering the OpenAI tool, ChatGPT. The GPT family of models includes GPT-1, GPT-2, GPT-3, and GPT-4 at the time of writing. 32 They are trained on large corpora of text, 33 such as BookCorpus, WebText (Reddit), English Wikipedia, and more. The GPT family leverages transformers and is pretrained on predicting the next word. Like other major NLP models, it can be fine-tuned 34 downstream to update the pretrained model’s parameters to parameters targeted toward more specific tasks, such as text generation. Notably, GPT-3 (with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 powering ChatGPT at the time of writing) also uses RL via user feedback to improve its model predictions. RL is covered in more detail in “Reinforcement Learning Algorithms” on page 101 . Apart from GPT, several other large language models (LLMs), such as PaLM2 (which powers Google Bard), Llama/ Llama 2 (Meta AI), and more 35 are trained on similar techniques. NLP has been growing at a fast pace, with many well-known LLMs being released in recent years (as illustrated in Figure 3-11 ). I encourage candidates interested in the field to learn more about these models and techniques. I remember exploring Word2vec 36 and GloVe 37 at work, and now there are so many other ways to develop NLP applications. Many foundational methods such as those two and models like BERT are still commonly used, and hiring managers I know still ask about them, so don’t neglect the foundations either! Figure 3-11. Evolutionary tree illustration of large language models; used with permis‐ sion from “The Practical Guides for Large Language Models” . Now that I’ve covered some foundational techniques used in NLP, it’s time to look at some interview questions. The NLP space and applications in generative AI have been moving very quickly, so we’ll see how things change! However, from speaking to hiring managers in my network, I know that all of them still expect knowledge on foundational topics and data preprocessing techniques for NLP use cases. Example answer BERT and other NLP models that have been pretrained can be fine-tuned. A large source of pretrained NLP models is the Hugging Face model repository. Pretrained models may include user-uploaded fine-tuned models of original models by Google, OpenAI, and so on, but users can also download models fine models by Google, OpenAI, and so on, but users can also download models finetuned on tasks like sentiment analysis. If I wanted to fine-tune one of the original models myself, I’d need to provide a labeled dataset for the NLP model. For example, for sentiment analysis, that would include examples of both positive and negative sentiment text; for chat‐ bots, I might provide labeled data with the correct corresponding answer to a help desk question; and for named entity recognition, I’d provide examples of the named entities that I’d expect the NLP model to correctly output. Example answer When starting from a raw corpus, a quick first step is to use regex (regular expression) techniques to clean up unwanted characters. Some downstream tasks don’t rely much on punctuation, but tasks like sentiment analysis could benefit from keeping punctuation; we can see how “!” could be useful for sentiment analysis. Next, we can use tokenization to break the text down into meaningful units, which often happen to be words; for example, “Susan is writing a sentence” becomes the five tokens: “Susan, is, writing, a, sentence.” Stemming and lemmatization both aim to reduce a word to its base form so that tense variations and derivations can still point to the same root word. Stemming is a rough heuristic that removes the ends of words (such as cars → car; history → histori and historical → histori). 38 Stemming is a cruder technique than lem‐ matization , which makes use of the dictionary forms of a base word; for example, in lemmatization, “studying,” “studies,” and “study” will all be lemmatized as “study.” This is useful for the NLP model to recognize that these words mean the same at their root. Example answer Possible challenges with NLP, even with robust pretrained models, could be homonyms/synonyms, sarcasm, or domain-specific language such as that of financial or legal documents and the like. All of these can be improved upon with better downstream fine-tuning with more data that targets the specific case. For example, you can provide more examples of the usage of synonyms so that the NLP model can pick out more signals on when to use which word. There are also inherent biases in many cases; pretraining corpora that are com‐ monly used for LLM training, such as Wikipedia, have a disproportionate number of male volunteer editors. Reddit, being a forum with a large text dataset, is also commonly used as a base for a training dataset and has a disproportionate number of male users. Laura Weidinger et. al (Google DeepMind and collaborators) have published a paper on ethical and social risks of harm from language models that discusses perpetuation It’s important to read through considerations like these; especially in interviews cov‐ ering language models or data acquisition (see Meta’s system design interview in Chapter 6 ), candidates being knowledgeable and thoughtful about potential risks (including biases) is important to succeeding at interviews. Example answer BERT-uncased has a tokenizer that will lowercase text input, so regardless of passing in cased (including uppercase) or all lowercase (uncased) text, it will be the same for BERT-uncased. BERT-cased , however, has a separate entry for the same words with different cases; for example, “The” will be different from “the” in BERT-cased. Thus, BERT-cased has the ability to distinguish between differ‐ ent semantics based on case. In applications where the case information doesn’t matter much, then BERT-uncased may be suitable. However, for situations where cased information is important, such as where proper nouns are valuable for the NLP task, BERT-cased will be preferred. You can see a trend in these questions: regardless of the NLP appli‐ cation (even if it’s generative AI!) knowing how to adapt to situa‐ tions is essential. Preprocessing will be different if proper nouns are useful (don’t lowercase everything), and while sometimes you might keep the punctuation (such as in sentiment analysis), some‐ times you don’t. Deeply understanding NLP techniques can help you respond much better in interviews than if you only memorize and regurgitate.'},\n",

       "    'text': 'Recommender systems (RecSys) are everywhere in our digital lives and are responsible for personalization of the web pages and apps you visit, such as Netflix, YouTube, Spotify, any social media site, and much more. One way to tell if a site has personali‐ zation is by comparing the order of items or products shown on its front page or search results when two different people are logged in. For example, what is shown on your YouTube front page is likely not the same as the front page of a sibling or friend. A recommender system recommends items or products that it thinks you might enjoy, interact with, or purchase based on your past behavior. For example, Netflix uses information on what shows and movies you’ve watched before as signals in its recommender systems to suggest new shows and movies for you. Since so many tech products use recommender systems, this is a common “default” category that interviewers at big tech companies will ask about. This section covers the basics of recommender systems techniques for those who are unsure whether they have the background knowledge in this area. Feel free to skip the subsections if you already have expertise in any of these areas. Regardless of your expertise, I’ve highlighted specific advice for ML interviews in the tip boxes to help you apply your knowledge of each ML area and excel in your interviews. To further supplement your knowledge on recommender techniques beyond the summaries I’ve provided in this book, I recommend the following resources: • Practical Recommender Systems by Kim Falk (Manning) • Use cases and papers via Eugene Yan’s curated applied ML repository Refer back to this section for reference material when preparing for interviews. Collaborative filtering is a common technique in recommender systems. The term comes from using data on preferences of many users and/or items (collaborative) to make recommendations for a singular user (filtering). This is based on an assumption that individuals with similar past preferences can share preferences for new, unseen products; hence, the algorithm will recommend new items liked by simi‐ lar users. There are two main types of collaborative filtering techniques: user based and item based. User-based collaborative filtering identifies users with similar interests and preferences and then recommends products or items to each of those similar users that they haven’t seen before. “Similar” users are calculated by ML algorithms, such as matrix factorization, which will be covered later in this chapter. Item-based collab‐ orative filtering identifies items that are similar to one another based on their user ratings or user interaction. Items are then recommended by the collaborative filtering algorithm if a user has previously enjoyed similar items. In user-based and item-based collaborative filtering, you generally need to know users’ ratings and preferences. If a user has left a good rating and review, then you can explicitly know that they enjoy a product. But users simply don’t have enough time to provide explicit, detailed feedback on everything—think about the times you’ve left a review; you likely didn’t do so for every single item you’ve used in the past. However, you can still calculate implicit feedback, such as the time spent on a YouTube video: if someone watches to the end, it could mean the viewer liked it more than a video they closed after two seconds. Using implicit feedback within a recommender system can help alleviate some common biases as well; people are more likely to leave an explicit review if they either loved or hated the product (and you know people are more vocal if something went wrong). In Chapter 4 , I’ll discuss model training and data preprocessing. For recommender systems applications, making sense of the avail‐ able explicit and implicit ratings during exploratory data analysis, model training, data preprocessing, featuring engineering, evalua‐ tion, and monitoring is important to discuss in interviews. Another common type of recommender system is the content-based system. In a content-based recommender system, you need detailed information about the prod‐ ucts themselves. This information could include traits of text descriptions (book blurbs, movie genres and descriptions), images (product screenshots), audio/video (trailers, product videos), and so on to create an understanding of which items are similar to one another. In contrast, the user- and item-based collaborative filtering described earlier relies on user preferences of items or products but not the traits of the items themselves. An example content-based movie recommender system could recommend movies based on the genre, director, or actors of movies that the user has previously watched and enjoyed, as measured by explicit and implicit feedback. Hence, a content-based recommender systems can be formulated as a ranking or classification problem, and algorithms like tree-based models are suitable. There are some pros and cons to using user-based/item-based or content-based rec‐ ommender systems. User-based systems don’t perform as well with new users; this is commonly referred to as the “cold-start” problem since there isn’t enough data on the users’ preferences because they may not have bought or rated any products yet. Content-based recommender systems might need less user-behavior data since they do not rely on other users’ preferences or ratings, which makes them suitable for newer users or niche items with less user feedback overall. But content-based systems might be limited to recommending items similar to what the user has interacted with before; therefore, new items are not introduced to the user, limiting the diversity of the products or items that the user might have enjoyed had they been recommended those products. Knowing the trade-offs between user-based, item-based, and content-based recommender systems can help you in interviews as well as on the job. In reality, explicit feedback can be hard to come by, and implicit feedback might not be perfect. Knowing how to mix and match all the data and RecSys algorithms at your disposal will help you stand out by a lot. Matrix factorization is a technique used in collaborative filtering. First, a matrix is constructed with users as the rows and items as the columns, with the ratings or pref‐ erences of a user on an item as the cell values. This is called the user-item matrix , as illustrated in Figure 3-12 . Since not all users interact with all items, the original matrix will be very sparse. For example, a user might have interacted with only a handful of items, but the online platform has thousands or millions of products. The goal of matrix factorization is to predict those empty values in the matrix—that is, how much a user would rate the items they haven’t interacted with before—and recommend those that you estimate that the user would enjoy. Figure 3-12. Illustration of matrix factorization; source: Google . A classic algorithm is singular value decomposition (SVD); however, I have never seen it used outside of practice datasets because of its expensive computational requirements. 40 For industry applications, if as an ML practitioner you choose to use matrix factorization, the chosen algorithm needs to be able to handle very sparse and large matrices since many online platforms have a large number of products and users. Algorithms such as ALS help address this issue since they use approximation via least squares (covered in “Summarizing Linear Regression” on page 68 ) to calcu‐ late their best guesses for the missing matrix values (how much a user might enjoy an item) instead of the complex matrix manipulations that traditional SVD uses. Now that I’ve covered the basics of recommender systems, let’s go through some example interview questions. Example answer Content-based recommender systems require knowledge of categorization or traits of the products being recommended to determine product similarity. Col‐ laborative filtering relies on user behavior and user preferences to recommend products that users with similar tastes enjoyed and thus can be more ignorant about the products themselves. Hence, content-based recommenders work well when there are not many users or items to construct the user-item matrix for collaborative filtering. In other words, content-based recommenders can still make recommendations when there is the “cold-start” problem, as long as there is information on the features of the items/products and some information on the traits or preferences of the users, without requiring more data on user behavior and interactions like collab‐ orative filtering does. On the other hand, collaborative filtering is suited for scenarios in which a lot of data on user behavior is available. At times, it can be hard to gather sufficient, meaningful features that describe the products, which makes content-based rec‐ ommender systems ineffective. In these cases, collaborative filtering can be more suitable. Anecdotally, I once worked on a project where a collaborative fil‐ tering algorithm (ALS) worked better for users who had used the web platform for a while but poorly for new users. Using content web platform for a while but poorly for new users. Using contentbased filtering with XGBoost worked better for new users, and we deployed different models depending on what type of user they were. Of course, this is only one example, and it may differ for your case. Example answer The cold-start problem: this is when there aren’t a lot of past data points avail‐ able for an ML model to train on. Therefore, the model won’t be able to learn enough patterns from the past to accurately predict the correct results for new data points. In recommender systems, content-based systems can be used, which require less user-behavior data but do still require sufficient product-feature data. This can help with the cold-start problem and still provide recommenda‐ tions to newer website users. Recommender systems can also encounter challenges with data quality, a prob‐ lem that isn’t exclusive to recommender systems. This can include errors in the source data—for example, due to a bug while ingesting the data. This issue can be addressed by analyzing where the source data has issues and then fixing it with the teams that handle data quality (at times, data engineers or platform engi‐ neers, or the MLEs and data scientists themselves). However, identifying that there is a data quality issue is important in the first place, and some preventative measures include using data quality monitoring tools like Great Expectations to alert the team when there are shifts in the data distribution or many missing val‐ ues, for example. When there are many missing values in an ML dataset, this is called sparsity . For example, users who sign up for a web platform with a questionnaire that asks for user preferences might not input several signup fields correctly or might skip them altogether. As an example, when someone signs up for a new Reddit account, there is a prompt that shows them common subreddits (subforums) that they may be interested in, but the user can skip this step. This is by design to make the web signup as frictionless as possible, but scenarios like this could cause data sparsity when you are trying to build a feature set for a RecSys. Possi‐ ble solutions include imputation (e.g., filling in missing values with the mean or using a tree-based method to fill in the data), using collaborative filtering or matrix factorization techniques, feature engineering, and more. Example answer Explicit feedback includes user ratings or reviews while implicit feedback has to be derived from available user behavior, such as the time spent on a web page or clickstream behavior. The benefits of explicit feedback include a clearly quanti‐ fied rating to use in machine learning as well as clarity when compared to implicit feedback. However, explicit feedback can be harder to gather since not all users will leave a review after every interaction (most don’t). Thus, measuring the user’s engagement or enjoyment via implicit feedback, such as video watch time or time spent reading on a website, might be used. Of course, this can lead to imperfect measures: is the user spending a long time on the web‐ page because they enjoyed the content or because they were confused about the text on it? Overall, it is important to consider the trade-offs, but in practice, you can often combine both feedback signals in your ML models. Example answer This is a common problem facing ML scenarios: there are a few classes or cate‐ gories that have many more observations or data points than others, and there are many classes/categories that have so few observations that they form a long To handle this issue, oversampling techniques may be helpful in simpler cases, such as creating more data points of categories that have fewer observations. However, when there are many classes/categories of observations, simple over‐ sampling techniques won’t be able to alleviate this issue. Additional techniques such as feature engineering and ensemble methods can be used instead, or in conjunction with oversampling. An example of ensemble methods could be cre‐ ating a separate recommender for popular items versus low-engagement items. In companies like Amazon and Spotify, combining RecSys with other families such as reinforcement learning helps ensure that long-tail products, artists, or To loop back to the beginning of this section, recommender systems are a common default ML topic to ask about since many tech companies’ ML use cases can be formulated as a ranking or recommendation problem. In big tech, I’ve seen an increase of combining NLP techniques or RL with RecSys, so be sure to check out the papers in “Resources for Learning About RecSys Algo‐ rithms” on page 95for existing examples of well-known RecSys for existing examples of well-known RecSysfocused products, such as social media (e.g., Facebook, Instagram), entertainment (e.g., Netflix, Spotify, YouTube), online shopping (e.g., Amazon), and more.'},\n",

       "    'text': 'In “Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning” on page 76 I briefly introduced reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. To recap, RL relies on learning through “trial and error,” and in the simplest of cases, it doesn’t need a preexisting dataset or known labels. RL will gather knowledge through a live environment, such as a robot navigating a maze multiple times, learning where the gold, traps, and exits are. Reinforcement learning has many applications in industry, such as autonomous vehi‐ cles, gaming, 43 as part of large-scale recommender systems, improvements of LLMs (RLHF 44 was a big part of improving ChatGPT ), and more. Hence, an understanding of RL is required for interviewing for teams that use RL. As mentioned earlier, RL is a somewhat more advanced family of techniques to use in production. So for new-graduate roles, you should focus on gaining a broader knowledge of ML first. Once you have that, knowing RL can help you stand out as a job candi‐ date (based on my anecdotal experience). This section covers the basics of RL techniques for those who are unsure whether they have the background knowledge in this area. Feel free to skip the subsections if you already have expertise in any of these areas. Regardless of your expertise, I’ve highlighted specific advice for ML interviews in the tip boxes to help you apply your knowledge of each ML area and excel in your interviews. To further supplement your knowledge of RL techniques beyond the summaries I’ve provided in this book, I recommend the following resources: • Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto • Use cases and papers via Eugene Yan’s curated applied ML repository Refer back to this section for reference material when preparing for interviews. In RL, an agent is an autonomous entity that interacts with an environment with cer‐ tain goals or objectives and learns to make optimal decisions through trial and error. An example is a self-driving car that doesn’t drive well but, while learning in a test environment, over time, learns which behaviors are good (following speed limits and road signs) and which are bad (such as bumping into trees and running red lights). While the model is the focus of most ML algorithms mentioned in the previous sec‐ tions, in RL the agent is being updated as the agent interacts with the environment. This does not mean there are no “models” in RL, but models are often used as sup‐ porting components that can be mixed and matched within the entire RL workflow. To illustrate RL, I’ll continue with the example of a self-driving car, simplified for understanding. Creating this basic RL agent requires the following building blocks: state, action, reward, and policy. There are many types of reinforcement learning, so the way the policy, state, action, or rewards interact in each type of algorithm may differ, and they may be mixed and matched with other con‐ cepts. Pay attention to which concepts you are being asked about in the interview. The RL agent is attempting to learn the best policy for how to react to the environ‐ ment in order to drive safely. When the agent is initialized, it doesn’t know the policy to choose the best action in a given scenario yet, so you just let it drive around in the environment. The building blocks for this specific scenario are: State The state that the agent encounters is a representation of the environment, or the state of the environment. This could include updating information about the car’s surroundings; tracking if there is an object to the left, right, front, or behind the car; and special tags for drivable roads and traffic lights and their status. Action The actions that the agent can choose in this example are: turn left, turn right, go forward, and brake. Note: this scenario is simplified to discrete actions, but com‐ plex scenarios might include how many degrees to turn the steering wheel. All the actions that the agent can carry out are collectively referred to as the action set , and the agent aims to carry out the best action at each decision point. Reward Each time the agent makes an action, given a state of the environment, the agent then gains feedback on how much benefit was gained or lost—this is called reward in RL. For example, during the state when there is a red light in front of the self-driving car RL agent, and the RL agent makes the action to brake, that can be rewarded with a positive reward. If the RL agent had chosen to go forward and run the red light, it would have gotten a penalty: a reward with a negative value, also referred to as a negative reward . The agent will remember that for the next time. The rewards are usually defined externally, and the agent doesn’t know about them beforehand, only learning about them during trial and error. Note that the wording “action made given a state” is deliberate; the same action in different states might yield different rewards. For example, turning right and crashing when there is a lamppost to the right and turning right when there is a right-turn lane will yield a negative and a positive reward, respectively. Hence, the state is essential to the decision and the learning of the RL agent, not just the actions and rewards . Policy The policy is how the agent chooses the action. In most cases, it will choose the action that is known to yield the highest reward, but this simple policy causes the agent to stop exploring new scenarios and often yields strange behavior. For example, the agent might have learned early on that turning right at a red light doesn’t have a negative reward (allowed under traffic law in many places in North America). The agent might exploit the fact, always turning right at a red light, instead of trying something new and stopping at a red light instead. So the policy can be defined as choosing the action given that state that is known to yield the highest reward, given that it balances additional factors such as exploitation of known rewards and explorationof the environment to learn new state-action where the agent explores more in the beginning of the training process and then exploits more after it’s experienced more states, actions, and rewards. In some types of RL, its policy is a parametrized model that is then updated; I’ll cover that more in the later section about policy-based RL. In summary, the agent uses the policy to choose an optimal action at a given state, after which it looks at the reward from the action and then updates the policy to improve for future states and actions, as illustrated in Figure 3-13 . Figure 3-13. Reinforcement learning policy update. In interviews, I’ve experienced more follow-up questions and drill In interviews, I’ve experienced more follow-up questions and drilldowns on why the reward is set up in such a way—for example, “Why did you choose to include a click-through as a positive reward but not the video watch time?” I’ll continue to build on the concepts of state, action, reward, and policy as founda‐ tions for the following sections. The RL agent generally wants to maximize the high‐ est rewards from choosing an action at a given state. However, without further nuances in the rewards, this can lead to short-term thinking, as you’ve seen when the agent only exploits and doesn’t explore . One way of addressing short-term thinking in RL is through adding more sophistication in the design of the reward beyond the immediate action. Thus, the long-term expected reward, which includes not only the reward from the immediate action but also possible rewards that are available to the agent in the future, is important. The expected total reward is calculated as part of the RL process as a weighted sum of the expected values of the future rewards that are available given the current step. I’ll illustrate this with the example of a robot that needs to find the way out of a maze, as illustrated in Figure 3-14 : • In this maze, bombs are bad while gold/money is good. • The exit is at the upper-right side of the maze, and there is a dead end in the mid‐ dle of the maze, which the robot has learned about during previous exploration. • If the robot chooses to go toward the middle, then it has a higher probability of going to the dead end and a lesser probability of going to the exit, which is cap‐ tured in the sum of expected values of future reward. • Hence, all things held constant, the total expected reward (aka the expected cumulative reward) from heading to the upper-right will be higher than the total expected reward from heading toward the middle. Of course, the robot needs to have explored those places already; before it has, it will still calculate the expected reward, but it might not be as accurate. Figure 3-14. Illustration of reinforcement learning: robot navigating a maze. Now let’s connect the concept of expected cumulative reward to the Q-value , which is the expected cumulative reward for taking an action in a particular state. TheQ Qfunction is a related concept; it takes the inputs of the state-action pairs and outputs the Q-values. The policy determines the action that the RL agent should take in a given state. To tie everything together, the optimal policy in Q-learning comes from selecting the action with the highest Q-value in each state. After each step, the policy is evaluated and the Q-values are updated using an optimization method called the Bellman equation. 46 The process is repeated until the policy converges and selects the same action at a given state. It is also possible to use Q-learning without policy iteration, instead using the simpler epsilon-greedy policy, which was mentioned in the previous section. This simpler format is often more practical in situations where the policy is less likely to converge or is expensive to learn or when the state and/or action space is very large. Because Q-learning doesn’t use a model to try to model the world—or in other words, the relationship between the states and the actions—it is a model-free RL tech‐ nique. Model-free RL like Q-learning requires the representation of the state and the action, but then it only needs to observe the rewards to continue improving its Q action, but then it only needs to observe the rewards to continue improving its Qvalues and policy (if using policy iteration). Common model-free RL algorithms include Q-learning, SARSA (state-action-reward-state-action), 47 and proximal policy optimiza‐ In model-based RL, the agent learns a model of the environment, which includes the way the various possible states are related to one another, called state transitions . The agent uses this model to make decisions about the best action(s) to take in a given state. Therefore, model-based RL requires explicit knowledge of the environment. Value-based RL is built on estimating the expected cumulative reward (aka the “value”) of being in a certain state and choosing to take a certain action, such as in Q “value”) of being in a certain state and choosing to take a certain action, such as in Qlearning, 50 SARSA, 51 and deep Q-networks (DQNs). The focus of these algorithms is on being able to predict the expected cumulative reward. On the other hand, policy-based RL learns the policy, the method or pattern that the agent uses to choose actions in a given state. Policy-based RL has a parametrized pol‐ icy function that can be optimized with gradient ascent methods as it learns the map‐ ping between states and actions. Gradient ascent is used because policy-based RL aims to maximize the expected cumulative reward, as opposed to gradient descent, which is used to minimize errors. Common policy-based algorithms include policy gradient algorithms such as REINFORCE and actor-critic methods (the “actor” learns a policy, and the “critic” learns the value). You can see an illustration of the various types of RL in Figure 3-15 . Figure 3-15. Overview of reinforcement learning methods; source: “Introduction to Reinforcement Learning” by J. Zico Kolter . On-policy RL updates its policy based on the data points collected while following the current iteration of the policy. Note that not all policy-based RL is necessarily on current iteration of the policy. Note that not all policy-based RL is necessarily onpolicy. 52 Let’s say that an RL algorithm takes an action (a1) with the current policy (p1), and with the observations from that action, it updates that policy with gradient ascent, notated as (p2): the latest learned policy. If the agent continues the next action (a2) with the new policy (p2), then it is considered on-policy. Policy iteration meth‐ ods like SARSA 53 are on-policy RL. In other words, if the agent’s behavior policy is its target policy 54 (the policy being updated), then that is on-policy RL. An off-policy RL algorithm updates its policies based on data points or experiences collected from a different policy or a mixture of policies. This includes Q-learning and DQNs. Coincidentally, these are value-based RL algorithms. To prevent confu‐ sion, think of on-policy versus off-policy as pertaining to whether the agent is using the newest policy that is being updated while policy-based versus value-based refers to the types of algorithms used to derive the optimal behavior. There are many additional algorithms to explore, such as temporal difference (TD), A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic), and PPO; if you’re interested in learn‐ ing more, I encourage you to take a look at the reinforcement learning textbook by Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto, available for free online and also included in the resources at the beginning of this section. Now that you’re familiar with introductory RL concepts, let’s look at some example interview questions. Example answer DQN is an extension of Q-learning; DQN uses neural networks to approximate the Q-values, which represent the expected future reward from taking an action in a given state (the same definition as Q-learning). In DQN, you have two networks: a target network and the Q-network. The target network is responsible for predicting the best Q-value out of all actions that can be taken from a given state (the target Q-value). The Q-network takes the current state and action and predicts the Q-value for a particular action (the predicted Q-value). To improve the Q-network, the difference between the predicted Q-value, the target Q-value, and the observed reward is used as a loss function for the Q-network. The weights of the neural network are updated based on the difference between the predicted Q-learning and the actual Q-value obtained through experience. The reason for using the target network is to ensure that the training results are more stable since with reinforcement learning and updating the Q-network with each step, the variance of each action can be quite large. After sufficient steps, the target network is updated with the new weights of the Q-network, and training continues. Example answer One of the main new advances that DQN uses is experience replay. Experience replay is a component before the Q-network and target networks that uses a simple epsilon-greedy method to take an action in the current state in the real environment and get a reward. It saves these actions, states, and rewards as expe‐ riences for the networks to use as training data. The reason for using experience replay is the sequential nature of reinforcement learning; the training dataset for the networks should have the sequence of rewards and new states that result from each action in the previous state. Example answer I’ll use the example of an RL agent that is part of a simple self-driving car. During its exploration, it first finds that turning right at a red light isn’t penalized (going by rules in North America). The agent may continue to exploit this knowledge instead of trying something new and learning to stop at the red light, causing undesired behavior: never stopping at a red light. Therefore, it is important to encourage exploration as well so that the agent tries out new behaviors. As the agent has explored more iterations of the environment, then it is safer to con‐ tinue to increase the exploitation parameter because at that point it may be more important for the agent to perform well and become an accurate self-driving car with the experience it has gathered so far. By allowing more exploration early on and then reducing exploration and increasing exploitation later, via techniques such as the epsilon-greedy policy, I can balance exploration and exploitation. In summary, to balance exploration and exploitation, I’d use an epsilon-greedy policy 55 so that the RL agent can explore more of the environment. As the agent interacts and learns more from the environment, the epsilon value is reduced, which makes the agent start to increase exploitation. Eventually, once the agent has explored sufficiently, it can exploit the good decisions it’s seen in the past and reduce exploration. Example answer In the case that there is a reward function in our RL agent, I would investigate the reward/reward function and see if it’s rewarding perverse behavior of the RL agent. It could be that the agent is exploiting ways to increase users’ click agent. It could be that the agent is exploiting ways to increase users’ clickthrough rate artificially, for example, by recommending items that are highly dis‐ counted. The artificial increase in click-through rate in this case leads to a positive reward for the RL agent. If the reward takes into account the cost of the discounts in the reward function, then the agent will be less likely to only opti‐ mize click-through rate at the cost of losing money on the product. Example answer Model-free RL is often preferred when a model of the environment is difficult to estimate or where the environment is constantly changing. This is because model-based algorithms try to build an accurate model of the full environment they are operating in. The “model” includes the transition probabilities from one state to another. Note: the use of the word “model” here does not mean other components of RL are not ML models. Specifically, “model-based” RL refers to the model of the environment, which is not exclusive to having other ML models in the workflow. Model-based RL is more feasible when you have a reasonable ground-truth rep‐ resentation of the entire environment, such as in a game environment like Atari or chess. These environments can be simulated many times, with (usually) deterministic results, so that the model that describes the environment and its state transition probabilities can be learned or built. In most real-world cases, it is less feasible to fully describe the environment, although with deep learning and a very, very large number of features that describe the environment, such as advanced sensors on a self-driving car, it might be possible. Generally in cases where the environment is not known, though, model-free RL can be used.'},\n",

       "    'text': 'Computer vision is a common ML application that includes image classification, image recognition, and so on. Examples include applying computer vision to medical images, such as X-rays, to classify whether a patient has a certain disease, or checking waveform images to classify certain sounds. Self-driving cars represent a complex use of various computer vision techniques. Some computer vision applications can be used across multiple industries. For exam‐ ple, optical character recognition (OCR) can be used to read checks for a bank’s online check-deposit system, detect logos in social media posts, or identify products in advertising images. 56 Regardless of the industry, ML practitioners leveraging com‐ puter vision ML benefit from domain knowledge, especially for high-impact applica‐ tions in health care or autonomous vehicles, for example. Interview questions about computer vision can rely heavily on domain knowledge, so beyond this book and resources on techni‐ cal know-how, I encourage you to read about computer vision applications specific to your target field. This section covers the basics of computer vision techniques for those who are unsure whether they have the background knowledge in this area.

Because of their visual and relatively easy-to-understand nature, image datasets are commonly used as beginner tutorials for deep learning. For example, I remember using the dogs and cats dataset in a Coursera course on CNNs, along with hundreds of thousands of other learners. Using ML on images has captured the imagination of ML enthusiasts and is popular for self-learning and portfolio projects. In research, many of the same datasets have propelled major advances in ML. You might recall in Chapter 1 I mentioned that the ImageNet dataset and challenge led to a development and explosion of accuracy in deep learning models that hadn’t been seen before. Here are some common public datasets that are used in computer vision: • ImageNet • CIFAR-100 • MNIST and related datasets, such as Fashion-MNIST • COCO (Common Objects in Context) • LVIS (annotated COCO) I encourage you to give them a try. If it’s your first time, you can try the following Colab notebooks: • Image Classification—Colaboratory tutorial (TensorFlow) • Transfer Learning for Computer Vision tutorial (PyTorch) Once you’ve familiarized yourself with the basics, I encourage you to come up with a project yourself. You can find more image datasets here or even collect your own: • Machine Learning Datasets—Image Classification on paperswithcode.com • Know Your Data Catalog by Google • Kaggle datasets Many online tutorials start with a simple image dataset such as classifying cats and dogs, the Iris dataset , MNIST, and so on. As such, they should be used for learning purposes, not for portfolio purposes. Candidates will find it hard to stand out with projects that only use these most common datasets 57 since we interviewers have seen thousands of applicants (not an exaggeration) with these projects. Try to find more unique datasets if you’re building a port‐ folio project. As discussed previously, examples of computer vision tasks include object detection, facial recognition, and medical classification. The data commonly used in computer vision algorithms are images, and often they are implemented with the CNN architecture, as illustrated in Figure 3-16 . CNNs are particularly effective for tasks like image recognition because they can intake the information encoding from images, where images are represented as matrices (input feature maps). The inputs are then “convoluted” via various convolutional layers in the network—a process that extracts information from the images’ matrix representation and creates new features that capture more nuanced information about the image. Convolution also allows information in the image to be flattened and compressed, which is effective for computation. Figure 3-16. A CNN takes in a dog image and represents the image in matrix form, then two convolutional modules extract useful features, which are fed into the last two fully connected layers that predict if the image is a dog or not; based on an image from “ML Practicum: Image Classification” , Google. For computer vision tasks, you can find many pretrained models online. These pre‐ trained models have already been tweaked and tuned on general tasks, such as image trained models have already been tweaked and tuned on general tasks, such as imageclassification tasks. It is time-consuming and resource heavy to train these models from scratch, so in practice, transfer learning is a common technique. Transfer learning leverages a pretrained model and modifies the last layers’ task to focus on the smaller task at hand. For example, the pretrained model might have been trained to classify one thousand items. At work, you have to classify only desk‐ top computers and laptops for an inventory-tracking task. You can download the pretrained model, use its architecture and weights apart from the final layer, and train only the final layer(s) so that it can specialize in those two objects. The result is a model that already has a general understanding of classifying images as well as the specialized tasks you’ve fine-tuned the model to do. This process is called transfer learning . Here are some tutorials: • Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning (TensorFlow) • Transfer Learning for Computer Vision (PyTorch) In interviews, it is helpful to be aware of transfer learning. In many situations, it’s useful to identify pretrained models to use and build on top of for the specific task at hand. In industry, it’s rare for the first option to be training a whole new neural network, due to the costs. If you only mention training a model from scratch for com‐ puter vision, that might show that you haven’t thought about or been exposed to practical situations enough. “Deepfakes” (fake images generated by deep learning) have been in the news for cre‐ ating fake images of politicians and celebrities. Deepfakes are an example of how results of generative AI have already started to get very realistic. They are commonly generated by networks referred to as generative adversarial networks (GANs). The architecture of GANs 58 focuses on two models: a generator and a discriminator. The generator learns and improves to generate good outputs. The discriminator learns and improves in order to evaluate whether the outputs that the generator cre‐ ated are real or fake. For example, the process training to generate images of Labrador retrievers (or Labs, for short) is as follows (see Figure 3-17 ): • Training begins. The generator is bad at generating objects that look like Labs, while the discriminator is bad at distinguishing the images that the generator cre‐ ated from real pictures of Labs. • As the generator is trained more, it learns to create images that look slightly more like Labs. As the discriminator is trained more, it’s better able to distin‐ guish the generator’s fake Labs from the real ones. The goal of the generator is to create Labs that look real enough for the discriminator to mistake them for real Lab pictures from the real world. • Finally, the generator gets so good at generating Lab images that the discrimina‐ tor can no longer tell them apart. Figure 3-17. Illustration of GAN training. Note that the GAN can generate passable images not in the training dataset that are good enough to fool the discriminator. (In this illustration we just have a flipped image for simplicity, but the real network can generate images even more different from the real training data.) Diffusion models are now common for image-generation tasks. I won’t go into details in this book, but you can read the original paper 59 if you’re interested. In addition to classification and image generation, there are many more use cases for computer vision, such as super resolution, semantic segmentation, and object detec‐ tion. I will go through a few common industry use cases here, but as mentioned before, I highly recommend you read about examples relevant to the company or industry you’re interviewing for, to further enhance your answers during interviews. Super resolutionis the task of taking a low-resolution image and creating a high is the task of taking a low-resolution image and creating a highresolution version of it. This task is also called upscaling . Common use cases are to upscale historical images, photos, films, and so on. In the health industry, this task can be used to increase the resolution of older medical equipment so that better diag‐ noses can be made if it’s difficult to upgrade the equipment. GANs and diffusion models are commonly used for this task. For more examples, here are some resources: • “High Fidelity Image Generation Using Diffusion Models” , by Jonathan Ho (Google Research Blog) • “SUPERVEGAN: Super Resolution Video Enhancement Gan for Perceptually Improving Low Bitrate Streams” , by Silviu S. Andrei et al. (Amazon Science) Object detection is a task used to recognize and localize objects in an image. It is more advanced than image classification, which classifies the entire image; localizing tells us where in the image the object of interest is located. As an extension, by applying object detection to individual frames in a video, you can conduct object tracking and follow a subject’s or object’s location in a video feed, and even across multiple camera angles. Object detection and object tracking with ML can be used in sports matches to track a ball, for example. Relevant algorithms to object detection include: • YOLO (You Only Look Once) and its newer versions by Chien-Yao Wang et al. • “Pix2Seq: A New Language Interface for Object Detection” , by Ting Chen and David Fleet (Google Research Blog) Semantic image segmentation is the task of assigning a semantic label, such as “com‐ puter,” “phone,” “person,” or “dog,” to every pixel in an image. Examples include iso‐ lating categories in images, such as isolating humans in the foreground from buildings in the background. One common example is portrait mode in smartphone cameras. Read more about semantic segmentation applications in the Google Pixel mobile phone camera’s portrait mode 60 as an example. You can learn more with these resources: • “Semantic Image Segmentation with DeepLab in TensorFlow” , by Liang-Chieh Chen and Yukun Zhu (Google Research Blog) • “Comparison of Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation” from Practical Machine Learning for Computer Vision by Valliappa Lakshmanan, Martin Görner, and Ryan Gillard (O’Reilly) Here are some more industry examples (note that they usually combine multiple techniques): • Amazon consistently experiments and researches computer vision to help cus‐ tomers shop online, for example, helping them find relevant products by describ‐ ing variations of existing products. 61 For instance, a customer could be searching for dresses and see one they like. However, the style is not available in the color they prefer. They can find dresses similar to the current product by typing, “I want a similar one, but change black to pink.” • Meta AI often seeks to leverage computer vision to improve automation on its social media platforms. For example, it has improved the automatically gener‐ ated text descriptions of images for people with visual impairments, 62 provided better automatic categorization of Facebook Marketplace items, content modera‐ tion, and so on. • Netflix uses computer vision to experiment with and improve thumbnails for Now that I’ve walked through an overview of computer vision, common datasets, algorithms, and use cases, here are some example interview questions. Example answer Common preprocessing techniques in image-recognition tasks include data nor‐ malization, data augmentation, and image standardization. Data normalization converts the numerical representation of the pixels in an image to a predefined range—for example, (0, 1) or (-1, 1). This is so the algorithms being applied to different layers can follow the same range. Data augmentation can help reduce overfitting on the training dataset. For example, if the training data coinciden‐ tally only includes cats that are facing to the right, then the CNN might not learn that cats facing to the left are also cats. Using various data augmentation tech‐ niques such as flipping, rotating, cropping, and so on, we can add more represen‐ tations of the same object into the dataset and help the CNN learn to generalize the detection of objects. Image standardization makes the dataset easier to work with by ensuring that images have heights and widths that are close to one another. During this preprocessing step, images are resized so that they are within a certain range of widths and heights. Example answer There are several methods we can use to handle class imbalance in image There are several methods we can use to handle class imbalance in imagerecognition tasks. A “class” in this case means a category or label; for example, an image may contain a “cat” or a “dog”. One way to handle class imbalance is to merge very similar categories, such as “orange” and “tangerine”. Of course, we’d have to determine the trade-off between the labels that are being merged. If the image-recognition model is responsible for labeling citrus fruits, then we should try another approach or merge other types of labels. A second option is resampling, which generates synthetic data or duplicates data points in the minority class. There are built-in tools in TensorFlow and PyTorch to do this for image-recognition tasks. Another method to handle class imbalance is to adjust the CNN’s loss function to weigh mistakes on minority or rare categories more than mistakes on common classes and labels. This is to help avoid underfitting on rare categories due to class imbalance. Example answer Adding a dropout layer (a type of regularization) within the CNN will set ran‐ dom neurons’ activations to 0; this prevents the layer from overexploiting a cer‐ tain feature. Another method is early stopping, where training stops when there isn’t meaningful reduction of the loss (which the CNN is aiming to minimize). Reducing layer complexity can also reduce overfitting because when the CNN layers are too complex, it may find more patterns in the images than are mean‐ ingful. For example, many images of singers involve them standing on a stage and holding a microphone, and the model might learn that the presence of a microphone in the image means the presence of a singer. Another technique for handling overfitting in image recognition is data augmentation, which can help add more diversity into the training dataset and reduce overfitting. Example answer If the existing network isn’t working well, for example, if it is underfitting and not classifying objects well, I might consider adding more layers of specific types—for example, adding a convolutional layer or rearranging the order of var‐ ious layers. This is also how researchers optimize various algorithm architec‐ tures, such as creating variations of layers on ResNet.Congratulations on making it through some dense topics! First, you went through a summary of statistical techniques commonly mentioned in interviews, including common techniques for ML, like regularization, and topics such as overfitting and underfitting. We walked through supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Then you dove into the various core ML areas: natural lan‐ guage processing, recommender systems, reinforcement learning, and computer vision. In this chapter, you were given some example interview questions as well as resources for each topic, which you can refer to when you’re preparing. Now that you’ve gotten an overview of the machine learning algorithms portion of technical interviews, let’s look at the training process of ML models and model evaluation.'}]},\n",

       "    'text': 'In this chapter, we will cover the ML model training process and related interview questions. To many practitioners, the model training is the most exciting part, and I agree ― it’s very satisfying to see the model become more and more accurate through‐ out the process. However, to begin ML model training, hyperparameter tuning, and running experiments with various algorithms, you’ll need to have data. Machine learning at its core is letting algorithms find patterns in data and then making predic‐ tions and decisions based on those patterns. Having useful data is the foundation of ML, and as the industry adage says, “Garbage in, garbage out.” That is, if the ML models are training on useless data, then the resulting model and inferences will also be useless. I’ll start with an overview of data processing and cleaning, which transforms raw data into a format that is useful for (and compatible with) ML algorithms. Next, I’ll go through algorithm selection, such as trade-offs between ML algorithms in different scenarios, and how to generally select the best one for a given problem. After that, I’ll cover model training and the process of optimizing the model’s perfor‐ mance. This can be an ambiguous and challenging process, and there are some best practices you’ll learn, such as hyperparameter tuning and experiment tracking, which can prevent the best results from being lost and ensure that they are reproducible. On that note, I’ll also go over how to know when an ML algorithm is good , in a practical sense. This involves model evaluation and comparisons against some baseline models or baseline heuristics. Model evaluation can also help you determine the efficacy of the model on new, unseen data and discover whether the model might overfit, under‐ fit, or otherwise underperform in the real world. I try to mention as many common ML interview techniques as space allows, but there are many more under the sun. Be sure to check out the linked resources to extend your learning and inter‐ view preparation! Throughout this chapter, I’ll give practical tips and examples to help you succeed in your ML interviews. By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid understand‐ ing of the data cleaning, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation process and be able to discuss them well in your own interviews. In this section, I provide a high-level overview of defining an ML problem, including why and how this shows up in interview questions. Consider the following scenario: you, the candidate, are walking through an ML project you’ve built. The goal is to predict if a user will click on a promotional email for a particular singer’s concerts. 1 Your interviewer thinks for a few seconds after your overview, then says, “It sounds like you can use the time that a user listens to artist A to determine who gets sent promotional emails for that artist. For example, if they listen to artist A for more than five hours a week, then send an email if artist A has a concert in the listener’s area. Given that there are simpler approaches that don’t use machine learning and achieve the same thing as your model, why did you choose ML ?” You freeze because you hadn’t thought of this question. It seemed like a fun, self You freeze because you hadn’t thought of this question. It seemed like a fun, selfdirected project at the time, and you just wanted to learn. You can’t quite understand what the interviewer is probing at with their question. What do you do? It’s important to understand beforehand how you can answer these questions well. Here are some possible angles: • Did you think about using a heuristic-based (i.e., rules-based) baseline first? In applicable situations, you can also use an as-simple-as-possible model, such as a logistic regression model, as a baseline. Then, the goal of your ML model would be to perform better than the baseline. • In real-world situations, new ML initiatives often aren’t launched or approved unless there’s clear business value to justify the engineering time and effort. For example, if the costs of implementing an ML system to recommend concerts from scratch don’t outweigh the expected earnings, then it’s easier to use heuristics. Projected savings on complexities, manual work, or time is also a rea‐ son to use ML over heuristics. Don’t worry though—the interviewer isn’t slighting your project but rather asking, “Why ML?” This is very common in the professional ML world. Asking “why ML?” doesn’t mean “you really shouldn’t have used ML.” It’s just the beginning of a discus‐ sion, one that ML professionals have often in their day-to-day lives. The way you respond to this question, especially for new grads, can be a good signal of whether you can transition well to working in ML in industry. Here’s what you could say that would work in this scenario: • Be honest: “To be honest, I just wanted to learn some new modeling techniques with a side project, and since I’m a heavy user of Spotify, I wanted to see how I could emulate its email feature with ML.” • If you’re talking about a work project: “In reality, I found that heuristics worked, but only for the most average users. For example, heavy users require a longer listening time to determine their favorite artists. Additionally, once we included other data like likes and add to playlists to the heuristics, we noticed a higher response to the promotional email. Thus, the heuristics became too complicated and hard to scale. That’s why we started using ML instead, so it could find pat‐ terns in a larger number of features.” Being honest is fine. As a new grad, I once prefaced one of my side project walkthroughs with, “This is a classifier for Ariana Grande images. I just wanted to do this project for fun, and there’s no real reason it had to be Ariana Grande. Here’s how I did it…” But I still managed to be taken seriously by interviewers, by justifying the project as an opportunity to use convolutional neural networks. If you’re doing your own side project and expect to use it for answering interview questions, consider what heuristic methods could achieve the goal you want. Later, you can use them as a simple baseline to see if the ML method is better. This will help you stand out from other candidates. I’ll cover model selection and model evaluation later in this chapter. If you don’t have ML work experience, you can still approximate the answer of some‐ one who built a similar project at work by doing the following: • Try out a few simple non-ML baseline rules and heuristics and note their performance. • Think about potential ways an ML approach could work over a heuristic approach. Common real-world reasons include saving on manual work or mak‐ ing the work more generalizable since ML can take more features into account after model retraining.'},\n",

       "    'text': 'In this section, I’ll summarize common data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques and scenarios as well as common ML interview questions that cover this step in the ML lifecycle. For simplicity, I’ll assume that data is available for the ML interview questions, even if that is a common challenge in real-life scenarios. I’ll start with an introduction to data acquisition, 2 exploratory data analysis (EDA), and fea‐ ture engineering. All data and ML roles will use data preprocessing and EDA. Some of the techniques in this chapter are specifically for ML but are still useful for data analysts or data engineers. Acquiring data, commonly referred to as data acquisition in the context of ML, can involve the following options: • Work access, usually proprietary data • Public datasets, such as from Kaggle, census bureaus , and the like • Web scraping (beware of some sites’ terms and conditions) • Academic access, such as being part of a research lab at your university • Purchasing data from vendors: — Some vendors also help annotate and label data, such as Figure Eight and Scale AI . — Your workplace or academic institution will usually help cover the costs, as the prices are typically too high to be worth it for individual side projects. • Creating synthetic data through simulations • Creating your own raw data, such as taking your own photos, crowdsourcing data, or using art/designs that you create yourself Companies expect to help onboard and train you, and they don’t expect candidates to be perfect. However, having knowledge about data acquisition will strongly benefit your interview answers. Between a candidate who will take less time to train and one who will take more time, guess which one gets preference for a job offer? Now that you have acquired the data, it’s time to analyze it. Your primary aim with EDA is to see if the data is sufficient as a starting point or if you need more. Thus, aim to get a high-level overview of the distribution of the data and find any flaws and quirks. Flaws and quirks may include too many missing values, skewed data distribu‐ tions, or duplicates. EDA also covers general traits of each feature, looking at the means, distributions, and so on. If you find flaws, there are ways you can resolve the issues later during data cleaning and feature engineering; what is important during EDA is simply to be aware of potential issues. For ML and data practitioners, it is important to have some domain knowledge. In my side projects on video-game pricing, I was well aware of industry dynamics and customer behaviors, being an avid gamer myself. At work, I need to learn about each domain to build useful ML models; for example, customers in telecom have differ‐ ent behaviors than those in fintech. My common approach is to run ydata-profiling , formerly known as pandas-profiling, and start drilling down from the generated report (an example report is shown in Figure 4-1 ). Note that this is merely a starting point, and using domain knowledge to suss out patterns or abnormalities will be important. What might be an issue for some industries and models might be expected in others. For example, in the case of a RecSys problem, it is more common to have sparser data than in a time-series data‐ set. Simply looking at generated stats isn’t enough. Also, some domains have algorithms that take care of common issues for that domain, and those issues are thus less cause for alarm. Figure 4-1. Screenshot of ydata-profiling; source: ydata-profiling documentation . More details on EDA are out of scope for this book, but I recommend reading Mak‐ ing Sense of Data by Glenn J. Myatt and Wayne P. Johnson (Wiley) for more information. After some iterations, let’s say that you’ve completed the EDA, coming to a decision point: the data seems sound enough (for now) to continue, or you might need to acquire more data or another dataset first; rinse and repeat. When interviewers ask what you’d do when you begin with an ML problem, they are expecting to hear you mention EDA at some point early in the process, after you’ve acquired some data source(s). It’s important to show that you’re able to look critically at the data and even find flaws, not just take in a precleaned dataset. After exploration of the data, iterating until there is a good starting point for model training, it’s time for feature engineering. In ML, features refer to inputs to ML mod‐ els. The goal is to make modifications to the dataset to ensure compatibility with the ML models, but also to handle any observed flaws or incompleteness in the data, such as missing values. The topics I discuss here include handling missing data, handling duplicate data, standardizing data, and preprocessing data. Some of the techniques overlap with what is commonly referred to as “data cleaning,” which can happen in more stages of the ML life‐ cycle than feature engineering, but is useful to introduce here. There are common imputation techniques for handling missing data that you should be able to mention in an interview, along with their pros and cons. These include fill‐ ing in with the mean or median value and using a tree-based model. Table 4-1 lists some things to keep in mind when filling in missing values. Table 4-1. Pros and cons of common imputation techniques Let’s say you’re planning to fill in the missing values for an ecommerce purchase dataset. You’re planning to impute the missing values in the age column in this data‐ set with the mean value; this makes sense, for example, if you are assuming that the missing values come from the same distribution as the observations where you have the customer’s age. (When making assumptions like this in ML, be sure to note them down in a central place; they will help you debug the model if the predictions go wrong down the road.) However, if you use the mean of all the available data before splitting it into training, validation, and test sets, then it inevitably captures traits of the test set. Hence, the ML model will be trained on imputed data that contains latent information about the test set, which sometimes causes the accuracy to increase for no reason other than the way the data was imputed. This is called data leakage . If you want to use imputation, then be sure to split the training, validation, and test sets first, and impute missing values in the training set with the summary statistics of the training set only. If you don’t mention this in the interview or explain it correctly, that’s a pretty obvious oversight in your ML model, unless you can defend your reasoning. There are just about an infinite number of ways that observations can be duplicated by accident, so this is one of the issues to discover when conducting EDA: • Data ingestion jobs might run twice due to error. • While doing some complicated joins, some rows could have been unintentionally duplicated and then not discovered. • Some edge cases can cause the data source to provide duplicated data. … and so on. If you encounter duplicated data, you can use SQL or Python to deduplicate the data, and make sure the records are represented in a format that’s easier for you to access and use later down the road. After you handle missing and duplicate data, the data should be standardized. This includes handling outliers, scaling features, and ensuring that data types and formats are consistent: Handle outliers Techniques for handling outliers include removing extreme outliers from the dataset, replacing them with less extreme values (known as winsorizing ) and log‐ arithmic scale transforms. I’d caution against removing outliers since doing so really depends on domain knowledge; in some domains, there are more severe consequences; for example, removing horse-carriage image data from a self consequences; for example, removing horse-carriage image data from a selfdriving car training dataset just because they aren’t a common type of vehicle might cause the model to not recognize horse-carriages in the real world. Hence, carefully evaluate the impacts before deciding on a particular technique. Scale features For datasets with multiple features with numerical values, larger values might be misconstrued by ML algorithms to have more impact. For example, one column is price, which ranges from $50 to $5,000, while another feature is the amount of time an ad shows up, which ranges from 0 to 10 times. The two features are in different units, but both are numerical, so it is possible that the price column will be represented as having a higher magnitude of impact. Some models, such as gradient-descent-based models, are more sensitive to the scale of features. Hence, it’s better to scale the features so that they range from [-1, 1] or [0, 1]. Be careful when scaling features. It is useful to combine differ‐ ent techniques or to use what you found while conducting EDA. For example, a feature might have extreme outliers, such as most of them being in the range [0, 100], except one obser‐ vation of 1000. Without checking, you might scale the feature values based on the min of 0 and max of 1000. This may cause the information contained in the features to be compressed. Data type consistency I was once working on an ML model and got results that weren’t what I expected, and it took me a while to debug. Finally, I identified the issue: a numerical col‐ umn was formatted as a string! Surveying your final data types to ensure that they will make sense once fed into your ML model will be useful before you go through the rest of the process; consider it a part of quality assurance (QA). An interviewer may ask follow-up questions about how exactly you have handled outliers, feature scale, or datatype consistency, so be sure to brush up on the rationale and trade-offs of each approach. Preprocessing data will allow for features to make sense to the ML model in the con‐ text of the type of algorithm you’re using. Preprocessing for structured data can include one-hot encoding, label encoding, binning, feature selection, and so on. Unstructured data is “information that is not arranged according to a preset data model or schema, and therefore cannot be stored in a traditional relational database or RDBMS (relational database management system). Text and multimedia are two common types of unstructured content.” 3 When you encounter unstructured data, the preprocessing may be different (potentially even transforming the data to become structured). For illustration purposes, I focus on examples of preprocessing structured data in this chapter. One-hot encoding of categorical data.  You may want to represent categorical data as numerical data. Each category becomes a feature, with 0 or 1 representing the state of that feature in each observation. For example, imagine a simple weather dataset where it’s only possible to have sunny or cloudy weather. You would have the following: March 1 • Weather: Sunny • Temperature (Celsius): 27 March 2 • Weather: Sunny • Temperature (Celsius): 25 March 3 • Weather: Cloudy • Temperature (Celsius): 20 But the “Weather” feature can be one-hot encoded to have features with all the possi‐ ble weather states: March 1 • Sunny: 1 • Cloudy: 0 March 2 • Sunny: 1 • Cloudy: 0 March 3 • Sunny: 0 • Cloudy: 1 One-hot encoding is often used because numbers are easier for ML algorithms to understand; some algorithms don’t take in categorical values, but this has improved over the years, where some implementations can take categorical values into account and transform them behind the scenes. One downside of one-hot encoding is that for features originally with high cardinal‐ ity (there are lots of unique values in that feature), one-hot encoding can cause the feature count to increase drastically, which can be computationally more expensive. Sometimes, lack of domain knowledge or understanding of busi‐ ness logic might cause issues in data preprocessing. An example is defining churned users as those who canceled a product within the last seven days, but the product or business logic actually counts churned users as those who left within the last 60 days. (If for some reason, the business logic doesn’t work well for ML, we can then discuss a middle ground.) Label encoding.  Label encoding maps the categories to numbers but keeps them in the same feature. For example, types of weather can be mapped to unique numbers, as illustrated in Figure 4-2 . Figure 4-2. Label encoding illustration. One of the downsides of label encoding is that some ML algorithms can conflate the scale and values to mean a higher magnitude of impact. To use our previous example, Weather can be label encoded: Sunny becomes 0, and Cloudy becomes 1. But to ML, this could conflate cloudy as a higher magnitude since 1 is greater than 0. Thankfully, in many ML algorithms you can use built-in classes (e.g., scikit-learn’s LabelEncoder class) so that the algorithm will know behind the scenes that this is just a categorization and not necessarily indicative of magnitude. Of course, if you forget to let the algorithm know that label Of course, if you forget to let the algorithm know that labelencoded features are, in fact, label encoded, then the ML algorithm will likely treat that feature like a normal numerical feature. You can see how this can cause issues if you didn’t address this during interview questions. Binning for numerical values.  Binning can reduce the amount of cardinality and help models generalize more. For example, if the dataset has a price of $100, it might not generalize the first time it sees $95, even if in the particular application, $95 is similar to $100. As an illustration, you can define the bin edges as [15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, 99], which will create similar price ranges like “$15–$25,” “$25–$35,” “$35–$45,” and so on. A downside of binning is that it introduces hard edges into the meanings of the bins, such that an observation of $46 would be seen as completely different from the bin “$35–$45,” even though it might still be similar. Feature selection.  Sometimes, your dataset will have features that are highly correlated—that is, there is collinearity between features. As an extreme example, you might have height in centimeters but also height in meters, which essentially capture the same information. There may be other features that capture a high proportion of the same information as well, and removing them might reduce accidentally overfitting or improve model speed because the model doesn’t need to handle as many features. Dimensionality reduction is a common technique for feature selec‐ tion; it reduces the dimensionality of the data while retaining the most important information. You might also use feature importance tables, such as those provided in XGBoost or CatBoost, and prune the features with the lowest importance—that is, the lowest con‐ tribution to the model. Now that I’ve covered some basics of data preprocessing and feature engineering, let’s go through some example interview questions. Example answer Feature engineering is about creating or transforming features from raw data. This is done to better represent the data and make the data more suitable for ML compared to its raw format. Common techniques include handling missing data, standardizing data formats, and so on. Feature selection is about narrowing down relevant ML features to simplify the model and prevent overfitting. Common techniques include PCA (principal component analysis) or using tree-based models’ feature importance to see which features contribute more useful signals. Example answer Being cautious with training, validation, and test data splits is one of the most common ways to prevent data leakage. However, things aren’t always so simple. For example, in the case when data imputation is done with the mean value of all observations in the feature, that means the mean value contains information about all observations, not just the training split. In that case, make sure to conduct data imputation with only information about the training split, on the training split. Other examples of data leakage could include time-series splits; we should be careful that we don’t accidentally shuffle and split the time series incorrectly (e.g., using tomorrow to predict today instead of the other way around). Example answer Sampling techniques, 4 such as oversampling the minority data classes, could help during preprocessing and feature engineering (for example, using techniques like SMOTE). It’s important to note that for oversampling, any duplicate or synthetic instances should be generated only from the training data to avoid data leakage with the validation or test set.'},\n",

       "    'text': 'Now that you have data ready for ML, it’s time to move on to the next step: model training. This process includes the steps of defining the ML task, selecting the most suitable ML algorithms for the task, and actually training the model. In this section, I will also provide common interview questions and tips that will help you succeed. At the outset of an ML project, you likely thought about what you wanted the general result to be, such as “getting the highest accuracy possible on a Kaggle competition” or “using this data to predict video game sales prices.” You might have also started researching some algorithms that are good at the task, such as time-series predic‐ tions. Determining what that final ML task will be is (often) an iterative process in which you may go back and forth between steps before you land on something, as illustrated in Figure 4-3 . Figure 4-3. Example iteration process during ML training. For example, let’s take a look at all the steps in a project to predict video game sales: 1. Define the ML task, model selection. You might start with an idea: use time 1. Define the ML task, model selection. You might start with an idea: use timeseries data with ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), because the problem seems simple—price prediction often uses time-series data. 2. Data acquisition. You might acquire a dataset with time-series data—that is, it only has the time, such as a date or timestamp, and the price. The future price is the output of the model predictions, and the historical prices are the inputs. However, you may run into a situation where using ARIMA doesn’t seem to be working out, and you troubleshoot by analyzing the source data more closely. It turns out that you’re combining data of the games from large companies (also known as “AAA” games) with smaller games from independent studios (also known as “indie” games). AAA games often have large budgets for marketing and promotion, so on average, they sell more than indie games. 3. Define the ML task (again). The next step is to reevaluate the ML task. After some thought, you decide to still predict the time series, thus keeping the ML task the same. 4. Data acquisition (again). This time, though, you already know what you may need to do differently so that the results will be better. Thus, you acquire more data: whether a game is AAA or indie. You might even end up hand labeling it. 5. Model selection (again). Now you realize the model needs to change since ARIMA doesn’t take categorical variables such as the labels “Indie” and “AAA.” Thus, you look online and find other algorithms that can mix categorical vari‐ ables with numerical variables, and you try one of those. 6. Continue to iterate the previous steps until good enough. You might rinse and repeat if that still doesn’t work well, acquiring more types of features, trying dif‐ ferent models, or doing feature engineering like one-hot encoding. The ML task could change along the way as well: instead of predicting the exact sales numbers, you might opt to predict the bins, such as (high, mid, low) sales, with high sales being above 50,000 units or something you’ve defined through EDA. If you’ve done a project from end to end, you know the iterative nature of the steps described in this section. You may notice that in this example, you can clearly see what led you to go back to data acquisition and what then led you to go back to defin‐ ing the ML task. There’s always a reason, even if the reason is just to see if the new approach works better than your current approach. This gives you a lot of interesting information to provide in response to your interviewer’s questions. Interviewers will want to make sure of the following: • You are knowledgeable about common ML tasks in their field. • You are knowledgeable about common algorithms related to said tasks. • You know how to evaluate those models. If an interviewer asks you what model you chose or what technique you used for any step in model training, I strongly recommend mentioning why you chose it as well. You don’t need to include the minute details if the interviewer didn’t ask you to walk through the entire project, but including the why will make your answer much more convincing. In the previous section, you saw how the steps from data acquisition to model train‐ ing are often iterative and that explaining the rationale for each of your iterations will help in your interview answers. To select the ML model, you need to define the ML task. To figure this out, you can ask yourself what algorithm to use and what task(s) is associated with the algorithm. For example, is it classification or regression? There is no prescriptive method to tell you the correct algorithms, but generally you’d want to know: • Do you have enough data? • Are you predicting a quantity/numerical value or a category/categorical value? • Do you have labeled data (i.e., you know the ground truth labels)? This could determine if supervised learning or unsupervised learning is better for the task. Tasks could include regression, classification, anomaly detection, recommender sys‐ tems, reinforcement learning, natural language processing, generative AI, and so on, all of which you read about in Chapter 3 . A simplified overview of selecting the ML task is illustrated in Figure 4-4 . Knowing the goal and the data that you have available (or plan to acquire) can help you initially select tasks. For example, different types of ML tasks are better suited depending on the labeled data that is available or if the tar‐ get variable is continuous or categorical. Figure 4-4. Simplified flowchart of ML task selection. Now that you have an idea of the ML task, let’s move on to model selection. Remem‐ ber that this is an iterative process, so you might not decide this in one go. However, you do need to select a model (or a few) as a starting point. In interviews, you will be asked about why you selected such and such algorithm(s) or model(s), and just going off gut feeling won’t be enough for a successful answer. As you saw in Figure 4-4 , you already have a place to start from based on the ML task(s) that you defined. So let’s dig deeper into some common algorithms and libraries (mostly in Python) that you can use to implement the task. I want to make a quick clarification on terminology: when you are selecting an algo‐ rithm initially, that isn’t technically model selection until you test it out and compare the performance of the resulting model. This term is often used interchangeably since you inevitably want to make the final decision based on actual model performance. As Jason Brownlee puts it in Machine Learning Mastery : “Model selection is a process that can be applied both across different types of models (e.g., logistic regression, SVM, KNN, etc.) and across models of the same type configured with different model As mentioned in “Defining a Machine Learning Problem” on page 122 it’s good to have a simple heuristic to compare your ML model with. If a few if statements or logistic regression can outperform a more complex model that you’ve selected, then you need to continue to improve your model before it will be viable. Here are some algorithms and libraries that can be used as simple starting points for each task. Note that many libraries are versatile and can be used for multiple pur‐ poses (e.g., decision trees can be used for both classification and regression), but I list some simplified examples for understanding: Classification Algorithms include decision trees , random forest , and the like. Example Python libraries to start with include scikit-learn , CatBoost , and LightGBM . Regression Algorithms include logistic regression , decision trees, and the like. Example Python libraries to start with are scikit-learn and statsmodels . Clustering (unsupervised learning) Algorithms include k-means clustering , DBSCAN , and the like. An example Python library to start with is scikit-learn. Time-series prediction Algorithms include ARIMA , LSTM , and the like. Example Python libraries to start with include statsmodels, Prophet , Keras/ TensorFlow , and so on. Recommender systems Algorithms include matrix factorization techniques such as collaborative filter‐ ing. Example libraries and tools to start with include Spark’s MLlib or Amazon Personalize on AWS. Reinforcement learning Algorithms include multiarmed bandit, Q-learning, and policy gradient. Exam‐ ple libraries to start with include Vowpal Wabbit , TorchRL (PyTorch), and TensorFlow-RL. Computer vision Deep learning techniques are common starting points for computer vision tasks. OpenCV is an important computer vision library that also supports some ML models. Popular deep learning frameworks include TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and Caffe. Natural language processing All the deep learning frameworks mentioned before can also be used for NLP. In addition, it’s common to try out transformer-based methods or find something on Hugging Face. Nowadays, using the OpenAI API and GPT models is also common. LangChain is a fast-growing library for NLP workflows. There is also Google’s recently launched Bard . If the task is from one of the well-known ML families, then there are also well-known algorithms specific to that task. As always, the heuristics I provide are only a common starting point, and you might end up trying other versatile techniques, such as tree-based models or ensembling. Now that you’ve gone through the steps of defining the ML task and selecting an algorithm, you will start the process of model training, which includes hyperparame‐ ter tuning and optimizer or loss function tuning, if applicable. The goal of this step is to see the model get better and better by changing the parameters of the model itself. Sometimes, this won’t work out, and you’ll need to go back to the earlier stages to improve the model via the input data. This section focuses on tuning the model itself but not the data. In interviews, it is more interesting to the employer to hear how you increased your model performance, rather than just that you got a high-performing model. In some cases, even having a low-performing model in the end can still demonstrate your suitability for the role if you were very thoughtful about your ML training process even when other factors were out of your control, such as data acquisition. In other cases, having a high-accuracy model doesn’t matter to the interviewer so much if you haven’t deployed it; it’s common to see models perform well in the training phase and offline evaluation but then do poorly in production or live scenarios. Hyperparameter tuning is where you select the optimal hyperparameters for the model via manual tweaks, grid search, or even AutoML. Hyperparameters include traits or architecture of the model itself, such as learning rate, batch size, the number of hidden layers in a neural network, and so on. Each specific model might have its own parameters, such as changepoint and seasonality prior scale in Prophet. The goal of hyperparameter tuning is, for example, to see if the learning rate is higher or if the model will converge faster and perform better. It is important to have a good system to keep track of hyperparameter-tuning experi‐ ments so that the experiments can be reproducible. Imagine the pain if you saw a model run that yielded great results, but because the edits were made directly to the script, you lost the exact changes and weren’t able to reproduce the good results! Tracking will be discussed more in “Experiment tracking” on page 140 . Loss functions in ML measure the difference between the model’s predicted outputs and the ground truth. A goal of the model is to minimize the loss function since by doing so, the model is making the most accurate predictions based on your definition of accuracy in the model. Examples of ML loss functions include mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). Optimizers are how the ML model’s parameters are adjusted to minimize the loss function. Sometimes, there are options to change the optimizer; for example, PyTorch has 13 common optimizers to select from. Adam and Adagrad are popular optimizers, and it’s likely the model’s hyperparameters themselves are tuned to improve performance. This could be an additional lever to pull, depending on the structure of your model and any hypothesized reasons why your current optimizer isn’t working out. If you’re interviewing for an ML job that requires NLP knowledge, take the time to do a small project to brush up your skills if you don’t have prior work or research experi‐ ence in the field. Being knowledgeable about common algorithms, libraries, loss func‐ tions, and the like helps you fluently speak the language of ML with your interviewer. While conducting hyperparameter tuning, you’ll need to keep track of the perfor‐ mance of each iteration of the model. You won’t be able to figure out which set of parameters performs better if you don’t have the records of past parameters to com‐ pare to. A company you interview with might have tools for ML experiment tracking. Gener‐ ally, it doesn’t matter if you have experience with the specific tool the company is using as long as you are aware of experiment tracking. I’ve tracked experiments with Microsoft Excel before, and so have many other practitioners. It is becoming more common, though, to use a centralized experiment-tracking platform. Examples include MLflow , TensorBoard , Weights & Biases , and Keras Tuner . There are many more, such as Kubeflow , DVC , Comet ML , and so on. For the interview, it is highly unlikely that it matters which exact ones you have experience in, as long as you are aware that you should be tracking the results somehow in a centralized location. Google has a Google Machine Learning Education site (free at the time of writing) for those who are interested in a more detailed overview; start with the Machine Learn‐ ing Crash Course (focused on ML and TensorFlow and runnable on Google Colab). Now that we’ve reviewed common considerations during model training, let’s look at some example interview questions. Example answer RL algorithms are useful when it’s important to learn from trial and error and the sequence of actions is important. RL is also useful when the outcome can be delayed but we want the RL agent to be continuously improving. Examples include game playing, robotics, recommender systems, and so on. In contrast, tree-based methods, such as decision trees or random forests, are useful when the problem is static and nonsequential. In other words, it’s not as useful to account for delayed rewards or sequential decision making, and a static dataset (at the time of training) is sufficient. Example answer Overfitting is a common problem, when the resulting model captures overly complex information in the training data and doesn’t generalize well to new observations. Regularization techniques 6 can be used to prevent overfitting. Not tuning common hyperparameters could cause models to not perform well since the default hyperparameters might (often) not work directly out of the box to be the best solution. Overengineering the problem could also cause issues during model training; sometimes it’s best to try out a simple baseline model before jumping right into very complex models or combinations of models. Example answer When working with imbalanced datasets, where one class significantly outnum‐ bers the others, ensemble methods can help improve the accuracy of results on minority data classes. By using ensemble models and combining multiple mod‐ els, we can avoid and reduce model bias toward the majority data class.'},\n",

       "    'text': 'Now that you’re training your model, it’s time to evaluate it and determine if you should continue iterating on it or conclude that it’s good enough. As an aside, often the business metric will and should be decided before starting the ML modeling. Business metrics include increasing click-through rate, improving the conversion rate of customers, or achieving higher satisfaction as measured by customer surveys. These metrics are not the same as the ML model metrics mentioned in this section; rather, they are used to see if the model performs well on the test dataset after being trained on the training dataset and evaluated with the evaluation dataset. Interviewers are looking for knowledge on common ways to evaluate models in the field. For example, time-series interview questions might expect you to know about mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and similar evaluation metrics, which were part of one of my interviews for a role in fintech. You’ll likely also discuss trade-offs between false positives and false negatives, a big part of what I encountered when I interviewed for my job in security machine learning. Other common expectations are knowing the variance bias trade-off and how to measure it, or accuracy versus precision and recall. Here are some common metrics used for evaluating ML models. The metrics you’ll choose depend on the ML task. Note that I won’t define all the terms in this book at the risk of it turning into a statis‐ tics textbook, but I will define and illustrate the most common ones. Additional resources are included if you want to understand the rest of the metrics in depth. Classification metrics are used to measure the performance of classification models. As a shorthand, note that TP = true positive, TN = true negative, FP = false positive, and FN = false negative, as illustrated in Figure 4-5 . Here are some other terms and values to know: • Precision = TP / (TP + FP) (as illustrated in Figure 4-6 ) • Recall = TP / (TP + FN) (as illustrated in Figure 4-6 ) • Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN) Figure 4-5. Illustration of true positives, false positives, false negatives, and true nega‐ tives; source: Walber , CC BY-SA 4.0, Wikimedia Commons . Figure 4-6. Illustration of precision versus recall. With these terms, we can then construct various evaluations: Confusion matrix A summary of the TP/TN/FP/FN values in matrix form (as illustrated in Figure 4-7 ). F1 score Harmonic mean of precision and recall. AUC (area under the ROC curve) and ROC (receiver operating characteristic) The curve plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate at various thresholds. Figure 4-7. Confusion matrix example. Research the company where you are interviewing and imagine what is valued there on a business level. Doing so can help you engage better in interview questions about model evaluation metrics. For example, in a malware detection ML system, false posi‐ tives are important to reduce because you don’t want to create alert fatigue, which causes people to lose trust in the malware detection model itself. Regression metrics are used to measure the performance of regression models. Here are some terms and values to know: = n  ∑ n | y i – ŷ i | ) • MSE: mean squared error • RMSE: root mean squared error • R 2 : R-squared Clustering metrics are used to measure the performance of clustering models. Using clustering metrics may depend on whether you have ground truth labels or not. Here I assume you do not, but if you do, then classification metrics can also be used. Here is a list of terms to be aware of: Silhouette coefficient Measures the cohesion of an item to other items in its cluster and separation with items in other clusters; ranges from -1 to 1 Calinski-Harabasz Index A score meant to determine the quality of clusters; when the score is higher, it means clusters are dense and well separated Ranking metrics are used for recommender or ranking systems. Here are some terms to be aware of: Mean reciprocal rank (MRR) Measures the accuracy of a ranking system by how high or low the first relevant document appears Precision at K Calculates the proportion of recommended items at the top that are relevant Normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) Compares the importance/rank that the ML model predicted to the actual relevance Here are some resources to learn about ML evaluation metrics, including more back‐ ground math: • Evaluating Machine Learning Models by Alice Zheng (O’Reilly) • An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python by Gareth James et al. (Springer) • Practical Statistics for Data Scientists by Peter Bruce, Andrew Bruce, and Peter Gedeck (O’Reilly) Now that you’ve decided on the metrics (and sometimes you’ll want to use a few), you’ll need to implement them with code. In common ML libraries in Python, there are already implementations of most of the metrics mentioned, so you don’t have to implement them from scratch yourself. The following metrics implementations are good starting points: • TensorFlow and Keras metrics • Scikit-learn metrics • MLlib metrics This list is not exhaustive, so take a look in the documentation of the library you are using. If the built-in implementations don’t fit your specific needs for some reason, then you can write something custom. If this comes up in the interview, it’s best to explain why. For example, if you wanted to mix and match a few different metrics from different libraries, you might have had to write some code to connect them all and aggregate them. For interviewers, it is important for you to demonstrate that you can think critically about ML evaluation metrics and various trade-offs. For example, using accuracy alone can hide a model’s flaws with its predictions on a minority class (a category that has very few data points compared to the majority class) if the model is simply very good with prediction on the majority class. In that case, it would be good to supple‐ ment with more metrics, such as F1 score. However, at times you need to explicitly make a trade-off. For example, in a medical model that predicts lung cancer from X-ray scan images, false negatives will have a very high impact. Hence, reducing false negatives is desira‐ ble. When false negatives are reduced, the recall metric is increased (see the previous section for a definition). But in some situations, on the way to reducing false negatives, the model may have accidentally learned to classify more patients as posi‐ tive even if they do not have lung cancer. In other words, false positives have increased as an indirect result and decreased the model’s precision. Thus, it is important to decide on trade-offs between false positives and false nega‐ tives; in some cases, the juice could be worth the squeeze, and sometimes, it might not be. It will be helpful if you can discuss trade-offs like this when you answer inter‐ view questions. The interviewer can tell from your thoughtful answers that you can think critically about biases in the models and can select appropri‐ ate models and metrics, which makes you a more effective ML practitioner. Using the model metrics I previously outlined, you can measure how effective the model has become at predicting previously unseen labels as compared to ground truth labels that were hidden from the model. Hopefully, you’ve experimented with a few tweaks to get here; even if your first model ended up being the best-performing one as measured by metrics, it’s worth it to see what’s not working. Your interviewer might ask about it, too! Before the model is deployed, though, it’s difficult to confirm that the model will indeed perform well live, in production. In this case, “live” means it’s out in the world, similar to being “live on air.” Production refers to software systems running with real inputs and outputs. There are many reasons why the model might perform poorly in production despite doing well on model metrics: data distribution in the real world is sometimes not captured by the training data, and there are edge cases and outliers, and so on. These days, many employers look for experience with understanding how models might behave in production. This is different from a school or academic perspective because with real inputs, models behaving poorly will cause real losses to a business. For example, a poor fraud-detection model could cost a bank millions. A recommen‐ der system that keeps surfacing irrelevant or inappropriate content could cause cus‐ tomers to lose trust in a company. In some cases, the company could be sued. Your interviewers will be keen to see if this is something you are aware of and if you have given thought to how to prevent scenarios like these. On the other hand, it’s quite fulfilling to work in ML knowing that if the model is successful, it could be part of preventing losses of millions from fraud or could be working behind the scenes of your favorite music streaming app! You can further evaluate the models before they go live in production and gauge if the models are indeed robust and can generalize to new data. Methods to do this include: Introduce some noise or transform the test data. For example, for images, see if randomly adding some pixels will cause the model to be unable to predict the correct result. Invariance tests Test if an ML model performs consistently in different conditions. For example, removing or changing certain inputs shouldn’t lead to drastic changes in the out‐ put. If you remove one feature completely and the model makes different predic‐ tions, then you should consider investigating that feature. This is especially important if that feature is, or is related to, sensitive information, such as race or demographics. Slice-based evaluation Test your model performance on various slices, or subgroups, of the test split. For example, your model might be performing well overall on metrics like accu‐ racy and F1, but when you investigate, it is performing poorly on people over the age of 35 and people under the age of 15. This will be important to investigate and iterate on, especially if you’ve overlooked some groups while training. For more on these evaluation techniques, please see Designing Machine Learning Sys‐ tems by Chip Huyen (O’Reilly). The goal of model evaluation is to see whether a model is performing well enough, or if it’s performing better than the baseline or another ML model. After each model training, you will have various model artifacts, such as the model definition, model parameters, data snapshot, and so on. When you want to pick out the model that has been performing well, it’s more convenient if the output model artifacts can be easily retrieved. Having model versioning is more convenient than running the entire model training pipeline to regenerate the model artifacts, even if you know the spe‐ cific hyperparameters that led to said model. The tools used for experiment tracking (listed in “Experiment tracking” on page 140 earlier in this chapter) often support model versioning as well. Now that we’ve gone through common techniques and considerations for model evaluation, let’s look at some example interview questions. Example answer The ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve can be used to evaluate a binary classification model. The curve plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate at various thresholds—the threshold being the probability between 0 and 1, above which the prediction is considered to be that class. For example, if the threshold is set to 0.6, then the probability predictions of the model that are above 0.6 probability of being class 1 will be labeled as class 1. Using ROC can help us determine the trade-off in the true positive rate and the false positive rate at various thresholds, and we can then decide what is the opti‐ mal threshold to use. Example answer Precision measures the accuracy of the model at making correct predictions (quality), and recall measures the model’s accuracy in terms of how many rele‐ vant items are predicted correctly (quantity). Mathematically, precision is TP / (TP + FP) while recall is TP / (TP + FN). Precision can be more important than recall when it is more critical to reduce FPs and keep them low. One example is malware detection or email spam detec‐ tion, where too many false positives can lead to user distrust. FPs in email spam detection can move legitimate business emails to the spam folder, causing delays and loss of business. On the other hand, recall can be more important than precision in high-stakes predictions such as medical diagnostics. Increased recall means that there are fewer false negatives, even if that potentially causes some accidental FPs. In this situation, it’s a higher priority to minimize the chances of missing true cases. Example answer NDCG is used to measure the quality of ranking tasks, such as recommender sys‐ tems, information retrieval, and search engines/applications. It compares the importance/rank that the ML model predicted to the actual relevance. If the model’s predictions differ a lot from the actual (or ideal) relevance, such as show‐ ing products at the top of a shopping website that the customer isn’t interested in, then the score will be lower. NDCG is calculated via the sum of the predicted relevance scores (DCG, or discounted cumulative gain) divided by the IDCG (ideal discounted cumulative gain). This is then normalized so that the result is between 0 and 1.In this chapter, I walked through an overview of the ML modeling and training pro‐ cess and how each step relates to the ML interview. First, you defined the ML task and acquired suitable data. Next, you selected the model based on which algorithms were suitable for the task as a starting point. You also selected a baseline model, start‐ ing with something simple to compare any further ML models against, such as a heuristic-based method or an as-simple-as-possible model like logistic regression. In all these steps, it’s important to note in an interview how you iterated on the pro‐ cess to make the model better, which could even involve going back to a previous step, such as data acquisition. While answering interview questions about your expe‐ rience with ML model training on your own projects, whether that’s a school, per‐ sonal, or work project, it’s essential to talk about the trade-offs you faced and the reasons why you thought a certain technique would help. Simply having a highly accurate model (as measured on the test set) isn’t enough, as it matters a lot these days to employers that the ML candidate has exposure to how models might behave in production. If you are applying for an ML role that builds the production pipelines and infrastructure, then it’s even more important. Finally, you reviewed how to evaluate the ML models and select the best one. In the next chapter, I’ll discuss the next major component of ML technical interviews: coding.'}]},\n",

       "    'text': 'In the previous chapters, I walked through the ML interview process and the ML algorithms and model training portions that are part of the technical interview. Tech‐ nical interviews can ask for much more of candidates beyond ML algorithms, stats knowledge, and model training, though. This chapter will cover one of those pieces, which is the coding interview. For jobs in machine learning, the kinds of coding that could be asked for will differ among companies and even among teams in the company. For example, when I was interviewing for data scientist and MLE roles, I got the following types of coding questions and tasks: • Company 1: Python questions related to data manipulation in pandas • Company 2: Python brainteaser questions (“LeetCode style”) only • Company 3: Data-related coding questions in SQL and Python Pandas • Company 4: Take-home coding exercise with a real-life scenario to code …and so on. There is a large variance in what companies might ask in a coding round of interviews. From what I’ve seen personally and heard from colleagues working as software engineers and hiring managers of software engineers, the ML coding inter‐ views are less standardized than the technical interviews for software engineering roles. On the bright side, interviewers for some ML roles don’t always ask candidates the most difficult “LeetCode style” questions, aka “LeetCode hards,” 1 since the candidate can be evaluated on their other skills, such as ML algorithm knowledge. This heavily depends on the role, though: for example, a candidate interviewing for an engineer title (such as MLE) at big tech gets the usual software engineering loop questions, which could include LeetCode hards. As usual, check with your recruiter. As I mentioned in “The Three Pillars of Machine Learning Roles” on page 12 , people working in ML are expected to clear both bars of programming and ML/stats. You aren’t expected to be the most skilled coder who is even more experienced than the average candidate for software engineer roles, but you need to be good enough to easily work with a team. You might encounter some teams where all you need is ML/stats knowledge, where you work with smaller scale data and never need to put things into production. Those companies may not test your coding skills during the interview process. But for this book, I tend to aim more toward ML roles where there is a blend of software engi‐ neering and ML since, without a way to distribute and serve the ML models, they don’t become part of the products that we use so much in our day to day. ML itself doesn’t make a Netflix recommender system, it’s putting that model into production and being a part of the frontend experience that customers interact with that brings in the user delight and thus revenue from ML. (For more on interviews that test your knowledge of model deployment, see Chapter 6 .) In this chapter, I’ll break down the common types of programming questions that show up in ML job interviews and walk through how to prepare: • A learning roadmap if you don’t know Python • Python questions related to data • Python brainteaser questions • SQL questions related to data Feel free to skip this section if you already know Python! The reasons I focus on knowing Python are: • Most, if not all, of the interviews for ML that I’ve been through assume you know Python to some extent. Most ML libraries you’ll be using at work have an imple‐ mentation in Python. • For interviewing, even software engineers recommend using Python in language • For interviewing, even software engineers recommend using Python in languageagnostic interviews over other languages because of the speed (of coding) and abstractions. Instead of spending valuable interview time coding out from scratch in C or C++, you could instead code just one or two lines in Python, which helps you focus on the important things in the interview. • Often in an ML job, you’ll be collaborating with other individuals and teams. Even if ML might be your main skill, the interviewers will be looking to see if you can write readable code that colleagues can read and use. Given these reasons, here’s a suggested roadmap to self-learn if you don’t know any Python or if you’re a little rusty. Find a book or course that focuses on practical code where you can immediately see the results. 2 Do the exercises in the book. Here are some resources I recommend: • Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart (No Starch Press): it’s free online, and the exercises are related to day-to-day activities. It starts with the bare basics of Python, such as using it for math ( 2+2 is the first line of code in the book), so anyone can get started with it. • For those who prefer video format, Al Sweigart has a playlist on YouTube that walks through his book in 15 video lessons. • Learn Python, Data Viz, pandas and More, tutorials at Kaggle . There are many similar online coding platforms, the most common (in North Amer‐ ica) being LeetCode and HackerRank . For simplicity, I will be using these two plat‐ forms the most as examples, but there might be other equivalents in your region or locale. Two classic beginner questions are Fizz Buzz and Two Sum . Try them on your plat‐ form of choice; it’s OK if you need to look at the answers during this early stage of learning. The goal is to understand the snippet of code—if you can understand this Even trying to complete one question a day or one question every two days is helpful for a beginner. Keep a tracker in your journal or phone. Try for an hour, and if you get stuck, look at the answers and read them or find video explanations until you understand . You can redo the question after a few more days to see if the understand‐ ing stuck. Avoid using rote memorization since the interview likely won’t have the exact same question, unless you’re supremely lucky. After you become familiar with some of the basics in Python, start with these tutori‐ als for using ML: • CatBoost: “Tutorial” • NumPy: “The Absolute Basics for Beginners” • pandas: “10 Minutes to pandas” The CatBoost tutorial can be a starting point for your first ML model! After this step, you can try using your own dataset or make modifications, try out other types of models, and build your own projects. Now, I’ll go through some tips for coding questions that may be asked during ML job interviews.'},\n",
       "   {'section': 'Coding Interview Success Tips',\n",
       "    'text': 'Before we head into the code portions of this chapter, here are some tips that you need to keep in mind. Your performance on the day of the interview is extremely important to optimize; no matter how well you’ve prepared, it doesn’t matter if the results aren’t apparent to the interviewer. I’ve seen many candidates neglect this, thereby letting their hard work go to waste. On the other hand, candidates that do well with these tips can make their performances disproportionately successful. Even if you are the one coding, the interview is still a discussion between you and the interviewer. It’s not always clear to the interviewer what your intent is for writing down a certain line of code. If you think out loud as you are typing, you can help the interviewer understand the direction you’re taking, and even help yourself. An exam‐ ple of thinking out loud is: “I’m going to write some tests next, but I’m thinking about what to test…” Even when you code an optimal solution, it usually isn’t a great sign if the entire interview is spent mostly in silence. You don’t have to (and shouldn’t) fill up every moment with thoughts and conversation either, as long as you’re providing enough information to your interviewer instead of just coding in silence. Here are a couple of examples: I was interviewing a candidate who was very quiet during the entire interview. I asked some questions to prompt them to explain their code, but they might have been nervous and didn’t provide any explanation. In the end, I couldn’t provide help to guide them toward an optimal solution. In another interview, the candidate shared their thought process, so I was able to follow up with clarification questions before the candidate went down a rabbit hole. The candidate was able to get on the right track. Note that this doesn’t mean you will be given a solution if you’re thinking out loud, but rather, by increasing the conversation with the interviewer, the interviewer can provide you with better clarifications as you code. As an ML interviewer, I’m looking for candidates who could become my colleagues. If an interviewee can communicate clearly without getting others confused, then it’s likely they can work with my team on our mutual projects and help them go more smoothly. As a candidate, you can actively shape the interview’s conversational flow to help you concentrate while working out some code. If you do need a moment to focus, just let your interviewer know! I’ve used this line before when I was thinking of a solution: “I’ll focus for two minutes or so while I try to come up with a solution, so I will be quiet for a little bit.” This also works well for behavioral interview questions like “Tell me about a time you overcame a challenge on a team project.” If you really don’t have an answer off the top of your head, and your mind is blank, you can say something like, “I’m gathering my thoughts before responding,” instead of making up some‐ thing on the fly while you’re nervous. The same applies during coding interviews; you can control the pace to help yourself perform your best, since the interviewer can’t read your mind. You should also keep track of time and not only rely on your interviewer to do so. As the interviewer, I’ve had to cut candidates short to move onto the next question when we’ve run out of time. As the candidate, you can clarify at the beginning of the inter‐ view how many questions you will be asked and roughly how much time you’re expected to take for each one. Sometimes, the interviewer will offer this information to you directly, but not always. For example: Candidate: “How many questions are there, and how long would you like me to take for each question?” Interviewer: “The interview is an hour, and we have three questions for you to go through, so roughly 20 minutes each. But the first one is the easiest, and the last one is the most complex, so I’d say if you try for 10 to 15 minutes for the first question, that is pretty typical.” By asking one simple question, you get more information to help you pace yourself and control the flow of the interview! Now you won’t get caught off guard if there are 10 minutes left and still a few more questions to go. I usually mention the number of interview questions close to the beginning of the interview. However, some of my fellow interviewers don’t do this; to be fair, it’s not a required step, and interviewers may not mention it for any number of reasons. For example, if the interview is starting late because there were some tech issues, then they may jump right in. As the interviewer, I also try to work with the candidate to keep time. If time is run‐ ning out, I will remind the candidate, but sometimes, if I see that they are really close to a solution, I might mention that we can take just a little more time on it. I won’t purposely let the candidate unknowingly run out of time if I can help it. But inter‐ viewing others is also a skill; as the candidate, it’s better if you also keep an eye on the flow to better suit your needs, not just let the interviewer dictate the entire pace. Bonus tip: don’t rush! Paraphrase the question to the interviewer to make sure you understand the question before you dive in. Similar to the “think out loud” tip is this advice: if you’re stuck, let the interviewer know. They’re usually not prevented from giving you tips. As a candidate, I’ve straight up asked for tips before! For example: “is there any specific direction you suggest that I take this question?” (I’ve cleared interviews where I’ve asked for sim‐ pler tips like this.) But I’m careful: each time I ask, I am aware that if I ask for too much help, it’ll be bad for my interview evaluation compared to someone who asked fewer questions. Still, I’d rather get a small hint and be able to complete 30% more of the question than be stuck for a long time while the clock’s ticking. Weigh your situa‐ tion and your time. It’s often better to ask your interviewer if you’re on the right track than to go down a completely different rabbit hole. “Most of the time, interviewers want candidates to pass the interview with flying col‐ ors! Thus, they ask questions to elicit the right responses so they have evidence the candidate is ready for the role, as well as provide feedback and hints during technical interviews. Thus, the interviewer should be perceived as an ally, not a gatekeeper,” says Eugene Yan, Senior Applied Scientist at Amazon. This should go without saying, but if you’re interviewing on a call, try to be in a quiet environment where there are no distracting background noises. If you have your video camera on, ensure the background isn’t too distracting or use a virtual back‐ ground. One interviewer told me that when they were interviewing someone, the candidate’s partner wasn’t fully dressed and was moving around in the bed behind the candidate. Not a great way to be remembered! Thanks to virtual backgrounds on Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet, you can avoid this kind of situation. In general, though, if I’m a candidate and I have no choice but to take an interview in a loud environment like a busy cafe, I mention that I may have to mute myself (on the call) because of background noise. In these situations, the interviewers have always been understanding. The main goal is for you to be able to speak clearly enough for them to hear; it can be awkward if you have to repeat yourself again and again. If you are interviewing on site, make sure you take care of the basics: don’t let your‐ self go hungry before interviews. If the company you’re interviewing with is offering free lunch for you after the interview, but you don’t have time to get snacks or break‐ fast on site, then try to make sure you eat something beforehand. In my case, I like to drink coffee every day, so I make sure I can grab it or buy it before the interview. Don’t leave things up to chance; even if the company has a kitchenette and free snacks, it doesn’t guarantee you can access them when you need them. I find it easier to just bring my own. I also bring a water bottle to on-site interviews and try to sleep well the day before. Of course, that’s not always possible, but try your best—you won’t regret it. I mention all these tips because interviews require a lot of concentration and mental and physical energy. It’s not just about your preparation on the technical topics; the entire interview, just like standardized exams, assesses your performance holistically. There are people who prepare a lot but perform poorly because of stress, nerves, or not enough sleep. There are people who prepare a bit less but perform better due to their good mental and physical state at the time of the interview. The one who per‐ forms better gets the job. It sounds unfair, but keep this in mind and do the best that you can.'},\n",

       "    'text': 'Now, let’s dive into the first type of programming/coding interview questions: data Now, let’s dive into the first type of programming/coding interview questions: dataand ML-related questions. These questions focus on using Python, such as using the NumPy and pandas libraries or ML libraries like XGBoost, to code up solutions to interview questions. The main difference between this type of question and the brain‐ teaser/LeetCode questions covered in the next subsection is that this type of question will relate more to what you’d be doing in your day-to-day role in an ML job. Depending on the type of company you’re interviewing for, these questions may be themed around the company’s product. For example, a social media company could ask a series of questions on how you’d pull information about new user signups, how you’d extract the answers to how active the users have been, and how many users have churned (left) within the last week. In this section, I’ll walk you through an interview scenario and provide two sample data- and ML-related Python questions that might be asked in the interview. Note that the datasets given in these examples are intentionally small and simple for the purpose of understanding. On interview day, your interviewer sends you a link to a HackerRank interface. When you open it, you see an interface where you can write your code. You double When you open it, you see an interface where you can write your code. You doublecheck with the interviewer that there are two questions in total during this one-hour interview and gauge that you should aim to spend 15 minutes on the first question and 30 minutes on the second one. The rest is buffer time and Q&A with the interviewer. The interviewer copies and pastes the first question at the top of the page, which out‐ lines the question in commented-out code. The coding interview interface may already have the question prepopulated, but in many data interviews I’ve been through at various types of companies, from big tech to startups, the question may not be on the sidebar but instead pasted into the coding area. As an interviewer, I’m speculating that this is more suitable for questions where you don’t have to run the full script as well as for interviews that focus more on the back-and-forth discussion. You double-check that you aren’t expected to run the code fully, as the HackerRank environment doesn’t happen to connect to an actual database. The interviewer con‐ firms this. At [the social media company that you’re interviewing for] , we are looking into user behavior. The data format we have is [sample data in .json format]. The data is pro‐ vided in the following two .json objects (referred to as “tables” for convenience). Table 1 : Table 2 : Table 1 has the new user signup time: • user_id • timestamp Table 2 has current accounts: • user_identifier • login_time • logoff_time Question: Given these two tables, which users’ latest activity is beyond 60 days since signup? Here are some things you should do as you begin to answer this first question: • Confirm what each data type means if unclear: is user_id in Table 1 the same as user_identifier in Table 2? (For the example answer, we assume that it is.) • Load up the .json format into your format of choice—for example, into a pandas DataFrame. • Think out loud—explain your approach and thoughts as you code. Confirm the question if you’re unsure; in this case, even if there are several columns, you don’t need some of them in the end, or you could simplify the results. The following code is an example answer for question 5-1 (a): Read in the .json objects as pandas DataFrames. For each user, get their latest login time, and store in a DataFrame named latest_login_times . Merge the two DataFrames. Now, for each user, it displays their signup time (timestamp) and latest login time (login_time). (Tip: if time allows in the inter‐ view, rename these columns to have clearer names.) Calculate the time between signup timestamp and the latest login_time , putting the results into a new column. Filter the users, keeping only the one(s) that have logged in over 60 days after signing up. For the code samples in this book, sometimes the line breaks aren’t as clean as what a code formatter would output, due to for‐ matting for print books. Now, the interviewer pastes the second question into the HackerRank interface. Suppose you have a new dataset, Table 3. Table 3 : Question: Based on the tables in the previous question as well as this new table (Table 3), how would you approach building a predictive churn model with this toy data, assuming that the model can be run on much more data than this? Assume that the day the analysis is run is July 25, 2023. Create the churn indicators and feature table, and verbally describe how you would proceed with modeling. Here are some tips for answering question 5-1 (b): • You should analyze the data, even if it’s a toy dataset, and walk through what you would do if it were larger. • Define what it means that the user will stay or leave. Does the company have a definition of churned users? (For example, are they users who haven’t logged on in 30 days?) Get clarity on anything that’s unclear to you. • Suggest some possible ways to find correlation—for example, if the user has a lower profile completion rate, are they more likely to churn? Also, outline and code out how you can test and confirm those assumptions in the dataset. • For modeling, what are some low-effort baseline models you could try? Perhaps regression or a simple tree-based model? • For a more complex model, what would you do? • If you notice that your time is running out, tell the interviewer you’ll give a quick high-level overview of how a complex model might work, and wrap it up. For illustration, here’s an example of what some rows of the table could look like after you load in the table form: The following code is the first part of an example answer for question 5-1 (b), which loads Table 3: The interviewer confirmed that if the user hasn’t logged in for 30 days, then they can be considered as churned. Note that we assume the current date is July 25, 2023. You create a binary column that indicates churn. The following code is the second part of the answer for question 5-1 (b), creating a churn indicator: From here you can join it to the features table: The DataFrame merged_df has your churn indicators, and now you join it to the table with features, features_df . Next, you decide on a simple ML model, CatBoost, and proceed to convert this Data‐ Frame to the required format (in this case, it’s easier if the columns are the features). An easy rules-based method could simply be that if a user doesn’t log on for 20 days, they might already be likely to churn (not logged in for 30 days). It’s kind of a simple “wait and see” rules-based approach, but it’s an option. Another option is that they will likely churn if they have not logged in for 14 days and also have added no friends. Our guess is that if they have no friends at that point, then maybe they don’t have an incentive to come back, so it’s possible they’ll churn. As mentioned in Chapter 4 , this could be a place to discuss scaling the data so that the features with larger “numbers” don’t throw off the scale of magnitude. Discuss cases if there are missing values (in this toy example, there aren’t, but there likely are in the real world). In the previous scenario, I walked through how a data- and ML-focused interview might go. I’ve been through many of these, sometimes as the interviewee and some‐ times as the interviewer. Here are some additional observations and tips that I hope will help you. FAQ: It seems like the interviews differ a lot. Should I try to practice on platforms such as HackerRank and CoderPad myself? A: The interview format might differ, but don’t fret about it. Once you do a few, you’ll get more used to the variety. For example, I’ve had interviews where I was expected to run the code correctly, and I’ve had others where best-effort pseudocode is fine. To use the Google interview example, coding in Google Docs, of course you can’t execute the code just like that. But if you aren’t used to the syntax or make a lot of obvious mistakes, the interviewer can still tell, even if you don’t need to run the code. FAQ: Thinking out loud seems distracting. What if I really can’t do it? A: If you know thinking aloud will distract you, then you don’t have to talk as frequently. However, I still recommend that when you’re taking a natural pause, such as when you just finished defining a function, take that time in between to quickly summarize what you did and why. As an interviewer, even if I’m watch‐ ing every single character the candidate is typing, I might have assumptions that are incorrect—I can’t read minds! In summary, try to explain at least during a natural pause. FAQ: I don’t have previous job experience working with data. How can I answer these questions well? A: I find that one big thing that people who work with data think about are the pros and cons of various algorithms. They also think about being more mindful of nuances in data. For example, going back to the interview scenario at the social media company, the interviewer might bring up that a tree-based model could work better on users with longer tenure, but it might not work so well for new users. It’s good when interviewees are able to come up with a solution to the cons—for example, a solution could be to use this model only for users that have more than 30 days of activity. As an example of nuances in data: if a table has a user ID as well as friend connections, but no information about how long the user has been using the social media platform, the numbers might not mean the same. Users who have used a platform longer might naturally have more friend connections. The signif‐ icance of having 10 friends differs between a user who has been signed up for just a month and a user who has a tenure of one year, despite the same friend count. The good news is that even without work experience in data, now that you know these main points, you can gain the same type of thinking via side projects. It sounds like a lot of requirements, but as a new grad, I was able to answer ques‐ tions like this based on what I learned from school assignments in econometrics. As long as you’ve had some hands-on experience (which you should during your interview prep and in building your project portfolio), you can do it. Here are some resources for further practicing data- and ML-related interview questions: • NumPy exercises with solutions (10.6k stars on GitHub at the time of writing) • pandas exercises (9.2k stars on GitHub at the time of writing) • pandas practice with Google Colab (University of Berkeley) When googling interview questions about data and coding, I find that the search results favor the brainteaser-type questions if you search for “machine learning programming questions.” The way I get around this is by specifying the Python library and then “exercises”—for example, “numpy programming exercises” or “pandas programming exercises.”'},\n",
       "   {'section': 'Python Coding Interview: Brainteaser Questions',\n",
       "    'text': 'Now, on to the next type of programming question, which in this book I’ll refer to as “brainteaser questions.” They are also commonly known as “LeetCode questions” (people often abbreviate this as LC), coding challenges, and so on. When searching for programming questions asked in ML-focused interviews, brainteaser-type questions pop up quite frequently in search engine results, though you know by now that it’s not the only type of question that can be asked. The rea‐ sons these kinds of questions are important, though, are: • They are more standardized. • They are shared with the longer-established software developer/software engi‐ neer interview loop. • For ML roles that heavily value software engineering skills, this type of question and interview loop overlap a lot with general software engineering interviews. • Brainteaser questions are still used predominantly to assess a candidates’ pro‐ gramming skills, even if in your real job the projects you work on will be more expansive than coding brainteasers. For those who are already familiar with this type of interview ques‐ tion, feel free to skip this section. It’s aimed toward those who are new to the brainteaser/LeetCode question type and explains how to efficiently prepare for it—that is, work smart, not just hard. If you have heard of these patterns, then you know it’s time to go practice and “grind LeetCode!” Before I dive into providing advice and resources, here are some patterns to look out for as you tackle your preparation for brainteaser questions. When you sign up for LeetCode or HackerRank, you’ll be faced with hundreds of questions on the platforms. This can cause analysis paralysis: there are so many ques‐ tions, what should I start with? This is often followed by overwhelm: there are hun‐ dreds of thousands of questions; can I really learn all of that? Don’t worry—you don’t have to. Many of the questions quiz similar concepts or pat‐ terns. The more you start focusing on identifying the common patterns and under‐ standing them from first principles, the more you can flexibly react to new questions, even if you haven’t seen them before. If there are one hundred questions, but they really test only 10 major patterns, it saves time to do two or three questions of each type initially (20 to 30 questions) instead of brute-forcing your interview preparation and doing all one hundred questions. Feel free to skim this section; you don’t have to fully understand everything in depth just yet. You can come back to review after you’ve started your interview preparation. Here are some of the patterns to look out for: • Array and string manipulation • Sliding window • Two pointers • Fast and slow pointers • Merge intervals • Graph traversal, such as depth first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) I’ll cover the first three patterns in detail: array and string manipulation, sliding win‐ dow, and two pointers. I’ve seen questions on those topics being asked the most across all data roles, while only job interviews that are more focused on software engineering might ask about additional concepts, such as graph traversal. I’ll link to resources to help you prepare for those additional concepts later in this section. For many programming questions, you’ll need to be able to manipulate an array, string, dictionary, or other data type. I’ll break down this statement into two parts to explain some definitions. First, arrays , in this case, aren’t literally limited to Python arrays or NumPy arrays; rather, this is a colloquial umbrella term. In the context of interviews, “arrays” could include Python lists and other iterable objects, which can be iterated over in a for loop. Manipulation , in this case, refers to tasks like updating, rearranging, and extracting the elements in the array to achieve the target outcome. This isn’t a pattern in isolation; rather, you’ll be using array and string manipulation skills in conjunction with other patterns like sliding window and two pointers. Simple functions you should be able to use at ease for these questions are: • len() • sum() • min() • max() • enumerate() Additionally, you might import modules such as collections or itertools or the built-in function sorted() , but these might be more trouble than they’re worth if you aren’t familiar with the syntax or if you can easily achieve the outcome with the sim‐ pler built-in functions (from Python documentation ): abs() aiter() all() any() anext() ascii() bin() bool() breakpoint() bytearray() bytes() callable() chr() classmethod() compile() complex() delattr() dict() dir() divmod() enumerate() eval() exec() filter() float() format() frozenset() getattr() globals() hasattr() hash() help() hex() id() input() int() isinstance() issubclass() iter() len() list() locals() map() max() memoryview() min() next() object() oct() open() ord() pow() print() property() range() repr() reversed() round() set() setattr() slice() sorted() staticmethod() str() sum() super() tuple() type() vars() zip() __import__() You should also familiarize yourself with common data types, which include the fol‐ lowing (remember that this book focuses on Python): Lists You should be comfortable looping through and slicing and dicing these up with their indices. Grab elements A to B, grab the last three elements, and so on. Strings You should be able to manipulate these like lists. Can you easily get the third let‐ ter? Grab the first one to three letters? The last letter? And so on. Various numeric types Does the interview question call for saving as int or float ? Are there reasons for one or the other? Dictionaries These will help you to save something with a key-value pair and easily access it. They are also fast. For those who are used to other languages, this is similar to Java’s HashMap . Sets They’re great if the interview question is focused on unique values. Tuples Great for when you want to return multiple results from your program in one go. Generators Pretty useful in real life, these can really save on the memory required, reducing errors that might happen when running a test case that processes a large amount of data. Arrays I don’t really use this Python “array” (not the same as a NumPy array) in inter‐ views because using the previous data types has been enough for me. However, it might be useful to be aware of this implementation, which can be more efficient for large amounts of data and for numerical operations. Note: my commentary on each of these datatypes isn’t exhaustive but is what I’ve found useful during interviews. Depending on the role you’re interviewing for, the difficulty of the questions may be much higher than the introductory summaries given in this book. It’s recommended (even necessary) to practice a lot on online platforms like LeetCode if you’re applying for an engineer role at big tech, which could include roles like MLE or ML software engineer. For folks starting out, do continue to build on the basics I introduce here. Let’s move on to the next pattern: sliding window . This pattern can be used for ques‐ tions where you need to manipulate or aggregate a range of values (see Figure 5-1 ). Before I learned this pattern, I used to do these questions in a brute-force way: in each loop, I’d (for example) sum over the entire range. However, with this approach I soon ran into issues. It works on smaller data, but when the full range is large, my solution might time out and thus fail the test cases (on LeetCode). In interviews that provided test cases, this meant that I couldn’t solve the question completely. Figure 5-1. Illustration of sliding window. The pattern helps you reuse the windows, or ranges, that are overlapping between each subsequent iteration in the loop. In the first iteration, you sum over everything in the required range in that first iteration. In the second iteration in the loop, instead of summing the second iteration’s range from scratch, you can use the total from iter‐ ation 1, add the new number, and subtract the first number. This way, summing over a range becomes a simpler problem of working with only three numbers. When I applied this approach, I found that for many problems where I used to fail, test cases would now pass when running over a large range of numbers. Now let’s go through some sample questions, simplified for understanding. Note that many online platforms such as LeetCode will have some boilerplate code, such as pre-defined classes, for you to insert the code; for brevity I don’t include the boiler‐ plate in the example questions and answers. Given the array of positive numbers [2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 3, 2] and the positive integer k = 3 , find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size k . In this example, subarrays of size 3 are: The following code is an example answer for question 5-2: Add the new item after sliding the window (see Figure 5-1 ). For the first k elements, sum them all together in the first full window_sum . We use k-1 because the list/array is 0-indexed, meaning the positions start from 0, not 1. Once we start sliding the window, store the results in an array named results . Deduct the item no longer in the window after sliding (see Figure 5-1 ). Depending on whether the input array is sorted or not, you may have different implementations. Always double-check your ques‐ tions to see if they specify a sorted or unsorted input/output. Here’s a good example of a continuous subarray sum . In case this link doesn’t work in the future, you should be able to find similar questions by searching the title of the question, “Continuous Subarray Sum,” or searching for “coding sliding window prac‐ tice problems.” Two pointers is the next pattern I’ll cover. Questions that follow this pattern can be solved by traversing through an array, list, string, and so on with two pointers (see Figure 5-2 in the example answer). Imagine a tortoise and a hare, each located at the opposite ends of a straight road, represented by the array. The tortoise and the hare each move toward each other in order to find the solution to the question, eventually meeting in the middle. There are other patterns as well; for example, one pointer could be fixed while the other moves. To illustrate, let’s look at an example of a two pointers interview question and some online resources for other relevant questions to practice with. From a sorted number array of unique numbers, locate a pair of numbers in the array that add up to a given target value. Return the indices (locations) of each number in the array. You may only use each number once—that is, you cannot add the same number with itself. Here is the example input: The example target output is: [1, 3] . The numbers at indices 1 and 3, which are 5 and 11, add up to the target sum, 16. Here’s a simple explanation for understanding. First, I’ll illustrate how the approach with two pointers works in Figure 5-2 . In this example, the pointers start from the start and end of the array and move toward the middle so that the sum of the point‐ ers’ elements gets closer to the target sum. Figure 5-2. Illustration of the two pointer pattern for coding interview questions. Here is the example code implementation: start_ind corresponds to pointer #1 (leftmost pointer) in Figure 5-2 , while end_ind corresponds to pointer #2 (rightmost pointer). Keep iterating on the sum, moving the rightmost pointer left if the target sum is smaller and moving the leftmost pointer right if the target sum is larger, as illus‐ trated in Figure 5-2 . If you are interviewing for roles for which the programming ques‐ tions are harder, the interviewer might continue to ask if you can come up with how to optimize or speed up your initial solution. It’s even better if you can come up with an optimized solution from the get-go! An example of further optimization is illustrated in the following code example. The following code example is more streamlined, which simplifies the initial answer: Depending on the test cases, whether they are provided by the interviewer or are ones that you come up with, there might be assumptions about whether you sanitize the inputs or not. In ques‐ tion 5-3, I’ll assume that the inputs passed in are positive integers, but sometimes there are trick questions, such as passing in negative numbers when your code assumes they are always positive inputs. Check with your interviewer and react accordingly. Here are some online resources from LeetCode for relevant questions using this pattern: • Two Sum • Move Zeroes • Is Subsequence This section provides further resources for practicing for coding interviews. The following are common platforms for practicing LeetCode-style or brainteaser The following are common platforms for practicing LeetCode-style or brainteaserstyle coding questions: LeetCode An online platform offering coding challenges and interview preparation resources for software engineers and developers HackerRank An online platform offering online coding tests and technical interviews Pramp A free, online peer-to-peer platform for practicing technical interviews Interviewing.io Anonymous mock interviews with engineers from tech companies The following are popular and useful guides for this type of question; basically, they are the same resources you’d use for a regular software engineer interview loop: • Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell: This book is con‐ sidered one of the most popular introductions to big-tech-style coding inter‐ views. It’s focused on the software engineering interview loop, but if you are interviewing for ML roles with a lot of overlap with software engineering loops (such as some MLE roles, ML software engineer, etc.), then you will need to pre‐ pare for those interview loops as well. • “How to Stand Out in a Python Coding Interview” by James Timmins. For more patterns, you can check resources such as the LeetCode 75 Study Plan for a full list of categories and read about them in resources such as the blog post “7 of the Most Important LeetCode Patterns for Coding Interviews” by Hunter Johnson. The company you’re interviewing for may have different platforms that it uses to assess your coding: HackerRank, CoderPad, Codility, and so on. Most major plat‐ forms are pretty similar, so as a candidate, as long as you’ve had practice on one of them, you should be able to get used to the others without having actually used them. Here’s one scenario in which you’d benefit from practicing a little beforehand: Goo‐ gle requires that candidates code in Google Docs, so you can’t run it; thus, take the time to ensure it’s valid code. For candidates who might be used to autocomplete on online platforms and editors like Visual Studio Code (VS Code), this was a huge thing to get used to.'},\n",

       "    'text': 'People working in data will likely encounter SQL at some point in their careers. In every company I’ve worked with, I’ve had to use both Python and SQL. Therefore, many companies also test some data questions with SQL specifically, although you may be able to choose between Python and SQL for some questions. Like the Python questions on data and ML, the SQL questions can be tied to the industry of the company or team you are interviewing for. For example, someone interviewing for a data scientist job on a large social media company’s search team could get questions like the following: • How many users made more than 10 searches over the past 14 days? • What percentage of users got more than one search result type? • You’re asked to create an autocomplete feature for search. How would you do a simple version of this with SQL? Here I’ve included a sample SQL interview question. Question 5-4 For this question, you are given two tables.

       "   {'section': 'Roadmaps for Preparing for Coding Interviews',\n",
       "    'text': 'Some of you may have experience with interviews and are already aware of the vari‐ ous types of questions that can be asked. When I was interviewing early on, I was caught off guard by so many different types of questions. For example, I focused on preparing for data- and ML-related Python questions but didn’t realize there would be brainteaser questions that didn’t use the common ML or stats Python libraries at all. From then on, I made sure to broaden the coverage of my interview preparation. It was easier said than done, though. Whether you already know Python or SQL, the formats of these questions might still be confusing. The time limit is also a tough thing to perform well under without sufficient practice. Interviews are isolated events, and as I’ve mentioned, doing well in an interview is a separate skill. Someone who is very well prepared and experienced but is very nervous during the interview probably won’t get selected. But a candidate who prepares smartly and performs well under pressure during the interview is more likely to get the job. This book is about ML careers, so I won’t comment much on whether interviews like this are the best system overall to gauge the performance of (especially experienced) folks in the industry who just haven’t practiced LeetCode brainteasers in a while. But what I do know is that when I interview, I take the time to brush up on some of these questions and make a timeline for doing so. You may already know what to prepare based on what was covered in this chapter, but without putting your hands to the keyboard, you won’t make that tangible progress toward getting a job offer. Each time I job-seek, I make a list of what I should prepare and create a schedule for what and when to practice. Here, I’ve included example calendars that you can use either as a university student or as someone making a job transition, with some varia‐ tions. I encourage you to fit the schedule to your own situation and get started. This chapter focuses on the programming interview preparation roadmap, but you can use the same format to prepare for all the interview types mentioned in this book (see Chapter 8 for a more general ML interview preparation roadmap). Overview: you’re a student in the final year of your bachelor’s or master’s program. You have some familiarity with Python and don’t know anything about SQL because you haven’t taken courses that happened to use SQL. You learn from an informa‐ tional interview with an alum working in the data field and from reading this book that you should know a little bit of SQL, in addition to practicing some Python brain‐ teaser questions. Optional, but encouraged: you also reach out to your program’s academic adviser or the equivalent, asking them to put you in touch with alumni of the program who went into data science and/or machine learning. They give you the contacts of two alumni, 4 who you find on LinkedIn and reach out to. One of them doesn’t respond, but you are able to have a call with the other one, who talks about how they prepared. You take down some notes and start making a plan. The goal is to start applying for jobs and interviewing in four weeks ( Table 5-1 ). Table 5-1. Example roadmap for a university student with preparation time set aside between classes and assignments, totaling about two to three hours a day, for about 18 hours a week The main reason that this roadmap can be relatively short is that I like to get out of the phase of only consuming learning materials as soon as possible. There are people who make less progress in twice the time because they don’t start getting their hands on the keyboard and practicing questions. This is like trying to learn math through reading and not solving anything yourself. I also make my roadmaps low pressure. If you can’t do three questions, then do one. Just one for that day. You can even look at the solution on at least half of the prepara‐ tion days. You can do this! It will be painful the first few times you try practice problems and find that you are getting stuck. It will be tempting to go back to watching videos and reading books, hoping you’ll find that essen‐ tial, game-changing, instantly effective tip. Don’t get stuck in that trap. The faster you start trying out practice problems and making mistakes, the faster you will learn. And, in my experience, the bet‐ ter you will retain the information. In my own experience, after preparing in a fashion similar to this roadmap, I contin‐ ued to iterate and improve after I started interviewing and failing some interviews. Maybe I needed to practice more medium-difficulty questions or get faster at identi‐ fying the coding pattern during the interview. But at least I got started, and failing interviews and getting better with each subsequent interview got me so much closer to my goal of landing an ML job than being stuck passively watching videos. All right. Say you’re not a student, but you are working in a field outside of machine learning. In addition, you have a kid you are taking care of, a shared responsibility with your spouse. Overview: you’re interested in the ML/data field and have been reading a lot of online materials, and you stumbled upon this book. You want to start taking the leap but don’t have much time and energy after work. You dedicate the time on weekends to family, but you’re thinking of taking two to three hours each Saturday and one hour on Sunday to interview prep. You want to make the leap and be ready to interview in six months, a realistic and sustainable goal ( Table 5-2 ). Table 5-2. Roadmap for a full-time professional and parent with about four hours set aside weekly Note that you will also need to schedule preparation time for the other sections in this book. So for example, if you are learning ML algorithms as well, that could also be a six-month roadmap. If you’re working and only have two to three hours free on the weekend or one hour each weekday, then you can adjust and extend the time frame. It’s all yours! Now it’s time to make your own roadmap. Feel free to include preparation for other types of interviews in your calendar as well. I wanted to emphasize preparation for programming interviews because it takes a lot of muscle memory to be able to quickly complete questions.

       "    'text': 'In Chapters 3 and 4 , you got an overview of important interview concepts related to ML algorithms, model training, and evaluation. For ML models to have an impact on users, whether they are your company’s customers or internal users and fellow employees, the model needs to be deployed . There are many levels of being deployed, but the most important thing is that the end goal for the model is achieved. If your model is being run manually and ad hoc every time the marketing team asks for new results, and that’s working well, then that could be your level of deployment. Or, you could have a fully automated system where the model goes out to customers as part of an A/B test, without the person who trained the model needing to do anything beyond the model training. That could be the level of deployment in a situation where the end goal calls for it. On that note, it’s not required for ML professionals to know all the details of model deployment. If you’re applying for one of the following jobs, however, it would be useful to brush up on the topics mentioned in this section. Roles that are likely to require deeper knowledge on model deployment include: • Machine learning engineer that doesn’t only do model training • MLOps engineer • Data scientist or MLE at a startup that doesn’t have additional dedicated people working on ML deployment Coincidentally, the more your job falls into this type of role, the higher the possibility that the interviews will also include the coding questions mentioned in Chapter 5 that overlap with software engineering interview loops. On the other hand, you can likely skim through or skip this chapter if the company or team you’re interested in has very defined roles, and the role you’re applying for does not need to do hands-on deployment, or the jobs you’re interested in are the following: • Product data scientist • Data scientist, applied scientist, MLE, and so on, that focuses on model develop‐ ment or other analytics This chapter will walk through model deployment, model monitoring after deploy‐ ment, and other end-to-end ML processes and tools. In addition, I will briefly sum‐ marize more advanced ML interview topics: systems design, technical deep dives on past projects, and product sense. This is so that you are aware of the topics and how to prepare for them if you do encounter them. The good news is that the more diffi‐ cult variants are only expected at senior or staff+ levels, not at entry level. An analogy I’ve used for a model being deployed is that it’s “live and on air.” In ML roles, this is an important part of the machine learning lifecycle, as discussed in Chapter 1 . Interviews for roles focused on ML deployment could touch on topics such as ML or software infrastructure (which facilitates the model serving), ML hypothesis testing, monitoring, model updates, and so on, once the model is deployed. This is a type of ML experience that may be harder to gain through self-learning since when we build ML models as a side project, there may not be users to test them on in the first place. Thus, it’s not often a priority in my experience when it comes to side projects. Next, I’ll outline some reasons why model deployment is important in industry and show you how to mentally connect from the model training and development work to the deployment work. The concepts of production and deployment were unfamiliar to me when I was start‐ ing out in the ML field. Hence, I include this section describing how I was first exposed to the concepts and how I bridged the gap from theoretical ML knowledge to standalone projects to full-fledged projects. I hope you find this story relatable and helpful. During my master’s program at the University of Toronto, I used Python on Jupyter Notebooks for some of my research projects. For these projects, I scraped and acquired data programmatically, wrote scripts to clean them, and analyzed the data. During this time, I used my laptop for computation: I installed Python packages directly on my laptop’s local environment. During development, I was able to quickly make edits to my code since I was the only person working on it. I didn’t back the code up apart from making copies locally on my laptop. After the ML model training and analysis were done, I created some visualizations and put them into a paper for‐ mat with LaTeX, and that was the end of that project. I never ran any of those scripts again. This is all suitable for a learning environment but very different from the working environment in industry. Many ML practitioners have shared their experiences shift‐ ing their mindsets, too: models now need to be deployed , able to be run, and easily modified by other colleagues, and the code needs to be backed up and rerun—often automatically! Production is a spectrum, depending on the company where you’re applying. For some teams, your main ML deliverable may be generating some plots after training the model once, and that could be similar to your experience in school or with a per‐ sonal project. For other teams (and anecdotally, these jobs are more competitive), production could come with expectations for uptime and running for millions of users. In those cases, what works for a simple development environment likely will be different from production. At my first job, the ML models I developed had to run for millions of users every day. Compared to my grad school projects that only had several thousand records, the computation that was required was very different, and I could no longer run it on my laptop. At that first job, I had to learn to remote session into our local cloud compu‐ tation and work with code on a virtual machine. I also had to learn how to use ver‐ sion control so that the code could be backed up and easily shared with colleagues. I had to write tests so that new changes to the code could be automatically tested; this wasn’t something I did in my school projects since I manually tested each change. Finally, my ML models at my first job had to be run with a scheduler so that it could generate predictions at least once a day—a far cry from my ML models at school that I ran only one time after the training process to generate the full results. I share all of this to say, if you’re able to gain some of this experience at school with collaborative projects that use version control (Git, GitHub, etc.), then you’ll be able to speak more articulately about some of these skills. If you didn’t have the opportu‐ nity to learn collaborative development, then it’ll serve you well to skim some of this chapter regardless of the role you’re applying for so that you can familiarize yourself with what you might need to learn on the job. Nowadays, I recommend that candidates try deploying a simple web app with tools such as Streamlit . In the past, I have deployed my side projects with Flask locally or on hosting sites like Heroku . This type of question comes up a lot from job seekers, such as “Should A know Docker?” “Should B know Tableau?” For example: • Should data scientists know Kubernetes? • Should MLEs know the math behind ML algorithms? • Should data scientists know Docker? My answer: you have to make the decision for your own situation on whether you should learn technology X at this specific time in your ML career, and here’s how. Let’s use Kubernetes as an example—you might be trying to figure out if you should know it. My opinion is that there’s an order to things: first, know what’s necessary for the role you’re applying for . Use the methods outlined in Chapters 1 and 2 to see what part of the machine learning lifecycle you’re interested in and then parse out via job postings whether the job you’re applying for requires you to know Kubernetes. If the role doesn’t require it, focus on preparing other core topics, such as model training and evaluation. If the roles you’re aiming for do require Kubernetes experience or other types of deployment knowledge, such as setting up Jenkins, GitHub actions, and general CI/CD, then definitely do some research and gain some hands-on experience with them in a toy project. Going a step further, it’s important to read through various trusted and relevant sources on the topic and gather a wide range of perspectives. For example, Chip Huyen, author of Designing Machine Learning Systems (O’Reilly), wrote in a blog post, “Why Data Scientists Shouldn’t Need to Know Kubernetes”: I also recommend Eugene Yan’s blog post “Unpopular Opinion: Data Scientists Should be More End-to-End,” 2 in which he writes: “I’m trying to convince [readers] that end-to-end visibility, cohesion (i.e., reverse Conway’s law), and ownership leads to better outcomes.” 3 But he’s not necessarily “pushing for data scientists/ML engi‐ neers to be full-stack and have in-depth knowledge of how to set up K8s, do PhD neers to be full-stack and have in-depth knowledge of how to set up K8s, do PhDlevel research, design front-end, etc.,” he adds. At this point, after looking at job postings and various trusted opinions, you might make a decision: “I don’t need to learn Kubernetes right now, but it might be helpful eventually. ” Whether your conclusion is yes or no, I think the best kind of answer assumes that you can reevaluate the answer when circumstances change. As with all careers, whether you should know X, Y, or Z technology will be fluid! As your career grows, you might find yourself in one of the following situations: • Moving into a startup and having to take on a broader range of responsibilities • Wanting to get promoted, and it’s required to have more experience in X • Wanting to move laterally into another ML role that requires more experience in X In those scenarios, you will eventually need to know X! But that doesn’t mean you need to know it now. Since you might be short on time for interview prep, treat it as constrained optimization. You probably have a limited amount of energy, prepara‐ tion time, and research time that you can spend finding an ideal job. You should pri‐ oritize the activities that give you the most optimized interview results. If that’s learning Kubernetes, then focus on learning it. If that’s model training, then focus on model training first and use the remaining time on other tasks. End-to-end is a term used to refer to an entire workflow, the “ends” being the begin‐ ning and the end of the project or workflow. There’s been discussion around whether ML practitioners should be more end-to-end, and you might be wondering whether you should be. To tie to the machine learning lifecycle, the answer is that you should know about multiple aspects of the lifecycle (refer back to Figure 1-5 ), not just one part of it. A similar term in software engineering is full-stack engineer or full-stack developer , and sometimes full-stack data scientist, full-stack MLE, and the like also refer to those roles being responsible for more of the end-to-end ML process. My answer is going to be similar to the “Should I know this? ” question: look into your job role and see what’s needed. Then determine what’s a priority and what’s most beneficial. As Eugene Yan writes in his blog post, “Unpopular Opinion: Data Scientists Should be More End-to-End,” it’s helpful to be aware of the end-to-end ML process, but you don’t have to be an expert in every single thing. Here’s my own story of becoming more end-to-end over time, but not as an entry Here’s my own story of becoming more end-to-end over time, but not as an entrylevel candidate. When I got my first DS/ML job, I didn’t know much about model deployment at scale or tools like Docker or Kubernetes, 4 and I didn’t know data engi‐ neering and SQL that well either. During that first job, I learned more about data engineering and SQL to an advanced level, and Docker to an intermediate level, but I still didn’t know Kubernetes. During my second job, which was at a startup, I was responsible for more of the machine learning lifecycle, so I needed to learn more about deploying models in a scaled-up manner. In that scenario, it made sense to catch up on those technologies and become even more end-to-end to better connect the ML workflow to the non and become even more end-to-end to better connect the ML workflow to the nonML portion of our app stack. I’ve spoken on the benefit of being more end-to-end in my keynote at the O’Reilly AI Superstream: MLOps , which is that understanding the deployment process helps ML practitioners be more efficient at completing ML projects. Overall, I think it’s benefited my career to become more end-to-end. However, this has happened over the course of many years: I didn’t know so much at the beginning of my ML career but instead picked up knowledge project by project, role by role. So don’t worry too much about claims that you need to know X, Y, or Z: evaluate your situation by looking at the roles that you are most interested in and prioritize the top skills to succeed in those interviews. You can also quickly gain a high-level overview of other skills from books like this one before diving deeper. You can pick up new skills later on the job or through continued self-learning, as I did. The following sections will cover cloud environments and local environments, model deployment technologies, cloud providers, and additional tooling. If you’re already familiar with the concepts or feel that some sections aren’t relevant for you right now, feel free to skip them. You can also come back to this chapter when the topics become more relevant. In Chapter 4 , I talked about model training and evaluation. What I didn’t detail in that chapter is the development environment. Models are trained somewhere and evaluated somewhere. That environment could be a local machine (such as your MacBook Pro), a cloud virtual machine (VM), and so on. Additionally, the environment where the models are trained usually differs from the production environment. For example, the model could be trained on a VM and bundled up as a pickle file, then copied over by a script to the production environ‐ ment, which could be in a completely different Google Cloud Platform (GCP) name‐ space that the person training the model might not have personal access to. Whether working on the cloud or locally, you have to be mindful of the handover between the model training and deployment. How are the model training artifacts being shipped over to production? What’s the production process, and where is each step in the process happening? Is there even a production process? Knowing the basics of the types of locations that ML workflows are built on can help you with the tasks of streamlining, automating, or optimizing ML deployment. This isn’t often asked about directly in interviews, but it’s an important foundation for other model asked about directly in interviews, but it’s an important foundation for other modeldeployment topics in your interviews. When I first started out in data, it was already more common to train models on a remote or cloud environment or provision a cloud VM. However, there are some things that aren’t running on beefy compute and can still commonly be done locally on your machine (depending where you work). These include: • Connecting to a remote data store and running a Jupyter Notebook locally for ad hoc exploratory data analysis • Doing a quick prototype of model training on a small sample of data but running the full training remotely • Testing the ML service locally, if the company’s tech stack is set up to run locally Local machines are often a development environment only, unless you’re a startup running a server off a single machine (very unlikely because of downtime or compute concerns). For this book, I won’t discuss cases where a single local server is being run. It is important to know how your development environment runs on a local machine, such as a laptop, so that you know how it can be replicated on your production envi‐ ronment, and vice versa. Setting up Docker (to be covered later in this chapter) and dependency management like Pipenv , Poetry , and the like in Python are essential so that what runs on someone’s laptop will run in production or even on another coworker’s laptop! While “cloud” has become the umbrella term for using remote servers managed by a third party, there are some nuances important to ML and different ways that cloud environments are deployed. Next, I’ll walk through a few types of development environments. Public cloud provider.  Public cloud refers to cloud services from vendors such as GCP, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and many more, which I’ll cover more in “Overview of Cloud Providers” on page 203 . What makes this service different from private cloud from the same vendor, however, is that hardware-wise, the same servers could run workloads from multiple companies—that is, they are multitenant . The upside of public cloud providers is their sheer convenience to set up, which makes public cloud a very popular choice for software companies. Here are some additional considerations with using public cloud: because of the vast resources of large vendors, using public cloud can be generally secure, but for regula‐ tory reasons, it might be the least ideal option. The process of migrating to the public cloud could cause downtime and disrupt day-to-day operations, which could be mas‐ sively inconvenient. If you’re preparing to work in a small to midsize company in ML, you’re likely to use public or private cloud. If you’re in a larger company in a highly regulated industry, you’ll likely use on-premises or local cloud and/or work locally. Public cloud became popular with the rise of platforms like AWS, prompting many companies to move workloads to cloud services from on-prem (on-premises) servers. However, many workflows or data stores still cannot be moved to the public cloud for regulatory reasons. On-premises and private cloud.  In some larger corporations, it’s not uncommon to own servers and host on-premises platforms on them. When I worked at a large telecom‐ munications company, it owned many servers itself. In fact, many of the servers that large public cloud providers use are leased from or owned by telecommunications companies. The company kept some servers for private use, and it had its own instances of GitLab and other services. Many enterprise software solutions also offer self-hosted solutions that come with the benefits of having enterprise support. This is called on-premises . The reasons for self-hosting many services include: • The company owns the servers, and it’s more secure than the same servers hav‐ ing exposure to the public cloud. • It’s easier in some cases for regulatory purposes, such as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a European Union regulation on information privacy. • Highly regulated industries like financial services and legal institutions have additional requirements for where the data is stored and if public cloud can be used to store personal identifiable information (PII). Private cloud sits between public cloud and on-premises/local cloud. The vendor, such as AWS, that hosts the servers guarantees that the servers are dedicated to one enterprise customer only (single tenant), 5 as opposed to shared hardware that the public cloud uses. Companies might use a mix of all of these, including public cloud, depending on what is feasible and balancing trade-offs of costs, convenience, and regulations. If your role is not responsible for evaluating, setting up, or auto‐ mating the deployment environments, the environments on which you are developing ML will not make a huge difference in your interview. When I worked on local cloud, it was slightly less conve‐ nient compared to private or public cloud (in my opinion) but overall required similar knowledge. If you’ve worked with one remote environment, you can work with another. However, if you’re part of the MLOps platform team proper, you might be required to learn more about the underlying workings of the plat‐ forms you work with. On the other hand, there’s also been a phenomenon called cloud repatriation 6 where companies that have moved to public cloud services are now reevaluating and mov‐ ing back to local cloud because of the various benefits of local cloud. In my observa‐ tion, larger companies have more bandwidth to self-host local cloud instances because they have more staff and thus can afford to have dedicated staff to maintain those local servers and communicate with the vendor consultants on how to trouble‐ shoot when things go wrong. When I was at a large company, one of its platform ven‐ dors was IBM; when there was an issue with our local instance of IBM’s platform, one of the senior members on the data science team would call IBM and schedule a meeting so that IBM could help troubleshoot. It was nice to have IBM support staff available around the clock, but as you can imagine, the costs for said support and consulting were high as well. Smaller to midsize companies might find maintaining a local cloud cumbersome, costly, and too much of an overhead. Public or private cloud might remain the most common option for this type of company. After models are trained and ready, it’s time to deploy them (to production)! At dif‐ ferent types of companies, this process can be very different. There are various levels of production, as I mentioned earlier in this chapter, but the goal is for the model to be useful . Here is a nonexhaustive list of examples of deployment, ranging from the least com‐ • The ML model is stored somewhere and run ad hoc; results are saved locally. • The ML model is stored and run ad hoc, but results are written to a central location. • The ML model is stored somewhere and automatically run as a batch process, and results are written out. • The ML model is wrapped in a simple web app such as Flask , and the app is spun up via a Docker container. • The ML model is wrapped in a simple app and called via Google Cloud Func‐ tions or AWS Lambda . • The ML model is served somewhere and orchestrated and managed by Kuber‐ netes; almost everything is automated. And so on. Depending on the company you’re interviewing with and its typical mode of deploy‐ ment, there will be different expectations for you. If you’re interviewing for a com‐ pany with a mature tech or ML team, you’ll likely be expected to know about the tools related to levels 5 and 6 in the preceding list. The company size is less the decid‐ ing factor than the maturity of the tech stack; when I was at a 200-person startup, our tech stack was working at level 6. This means that, in general, if you’re in an ML role that is responsible for parts of the platform, deployment, and production lifecycle, you’ll need to spend more time studying if you don’t happen to have work experience in these technologies and tools. For ML teams with low maturity, such as those at levels 1–4, you might be juggling this role while also being the same person who trains the ML models. As an ML team grows more mature, it’ll become less useful for the same person to train the model and also build an automated platform. A person or team doing multi‐ ple things at once won’t be able to focus on making the ML models the best they can be, especially as more and more models are needed as the company grows. For example, an ecommerce company that started out making a simple forecasting model for inventory may want to develop models to recommend items in its newslet‐ ters. Then, the company may want to add a robust model for sales periods only. Or, perhaps fraudulent accounts were using the company’s goods to obscure the flow of stolen money; someone at the company may issue a directive to create a fraud stolen money; someone at the company may issue a directive to create a frauddetection model. At the point where an ML team acquires more and more responsibilities, the team will become tired of duct tape (quick, ad hoc) fixes and want to start introducing some developer overhead, such as containerization and version control. Today, com‐ panies generally start with those right from the beginning, but only a few years ago, some teams with less mature software or ML teams might not have been using Docker, and you’d be surprised to learn that some companies and teams only started formalizing Git a few years ago (as of the time of writing in 2023). Nowadays, it’s likely that knowledge about Docker and version control (such as Git) are more expected skills than before. Docker allows software applications and their dependencies to be wrapped up together and be portable —that is, with a Docker container, the same software should be able to run the same way on any compatible machine. On the other hand, running the same script on your colleague’s system Python environment might work fine, but running the same script on your laptop might not work without the environment being portable . Thus, Docker also serves the purpose of making the environment independent of the infrastructure it’s running on. Containerization isn’t new: in the past, VMs were pretty commonly used to address a similar problem—for example, someone working on a Linux machine wanting to test something on Windows could install a Windows VM, and vice versa. The downside is that the installations were entire operating systems, which is a lot of bloat just to test out something on another environment. With Docker containers, you don’t need to install the entire OS (unless specifically desired). For example, you can have a Docker image that specifies the Python environment; 8 the container uses the host’s operating system but still provides the isolation from other parts of the host machine that VMs provide. A Docker image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker con‐ tainer . 9 So images are like a mold. The instructions that define this mold are in a Dockerfile . A Docker container is the runnable instance of an image, which you can create, start, stop, and so on. You can create multiple identical containers from one single image. For an example, see Figure 6-1 . Figure 6-1. Dockerfile, Docker image, and Docker container. As a person who primarily trains ML models but who has also set up end-to-end ML deployment infrastructure, I haven’t been asked too much detail about the inner workings of Docker in interviews. I think the most important thing that I was often asked early in my career is whether I have practical, hands-on knowledge of using Docker. So even if you haven’t used it previously, experimenting with it gives you a leg up on candidates who didn’t have hands-on knowledge, ceteris paribus. Modern web services are often expected by users to have high availability. Good prac‐ tices like dockerization help package software in an easily portable manner, which help applications be released without downtime. However, that is only a piece of the puzzle; technologies like Kubernetes orchestrate containerized applications to run at the right place and the right times in an automated way. Of course, people (could it be you?) who are responsible for ML application orchestration will need to set up the Note that the responsibilities of a job role that touches on orchestration could differ among companies. Some companies might have a DevOps engineer maintain the orchestration infrastructure. However, I’ve seen in many larger and more mature ML organizations that there are infrastructure engineers, MLOps engineers, and MLEs who might all be responsible for at least part of the uptime requirements for ML applications. I’ve given an overview of Docker and Kubernetes in this book, but since I don’t have sufficient space to cover as much as a DevOps/MLOps book could focus on, here are some additional resources from O’Reilly that I have found useful: • Kubernetes: Up and Running by Brendan Burns et al. • Kubernetes Best Practices by Brendan Burns et al. If all of this is completely new to you, don’t worry. In my work experience, I’ve been able to learn most of the containerization and orchestration tools on the job. In fact, I’d say that hands-on learning on work projects within working hours has contrib‐ uted to most of my knowledge in this space so far. Here I discuss a couple of other tools that are helpful to know about: ML pipelines and platforms Nowadays, there are many ML platforms that handle parts of the automation for ML workflows, and it’s useful to be aware of them. If you happen to find out before the interview which platform(s) the company you’re interviewing for uses, be sure to check out said platform’s documentation page to find out common terminology and tools that the platform provides. These ML platforms can include Airflow, MLflow, Kubeflow, Mage, and the like. CI/CD In an organization where the software team is more automated and mature, you might need to know more about continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD) tools and technologies. Having these tools set up allows for software to be automatically deployed when new commits are merged into the main branch (this is a simplified example for understanding). This reduces much of the man‐ ual work when updates need to be refreshed manually all the time. See Figure 6-2 for an example of automating updating the source code, creating the software build, 11 testing, and deploying. Some tools for CI/CD, in combination with ver‐ sion control, could include Jenkins, GitHub actions, and GitLab CI/CD. Figure 6-2. Sample flowchart of what is automated with CI/CD after a code change; source: “CI/CD Pipeline: A Gentle Introduction,” Marko Anastasov, Semaphore . There are also specific fields in ML related to on-device deployment, or edge deploy‐ ment. Techniques like quantization 12 make ML models smaller and efficient enough to run on mobile devices, IoT devices, and other types of edge devices. This requires a lot of additional considerations when it comes to deployment. This is a more advanced topic, so I encourage you to supplement your knowledge if you require it for interviews. You can read more about on-device ML via the following resources: • “On-Device Machine Learning” by Google for Developers • AI and Machine Learning for On-Device Development by Laurence Moroney (O’Reilly) • “TensorFlow Lite: Solution for Running ML On-Device” , a talk by Pete Warden and Nupur Garg (Google) Even if you are applying primarily for the roles that do ML model training, don’t underestimate how some of this higher-level knowledge can help you in your inter‐ views. Since there are many knowledgeable candidates in the ML training space, if you are tied on that front with another candidate, having more knowledge or experi‐ ence with model deployment practices and collaborating cross-team could be a tiebreaker. However, you should prioritize the core ML training competencies in Chapters 3 and 4 if your role is less focused on ML operations. As a personal anecdote, at some places where I’ve successfully gotten an offer, I’ve received feedback that the interviewers were impressed with how I connected the ML training to the deployment process. For example, during interviews I mentioned how I optimized ML inputs to ensure that the ML model could still run fast enough to satisfy the requirements in production. Candidates who are mindful of the end-to satisfy the requirements in production. Candidates who are mindful of the end-toend process can shorten the time it takes to go from ML model prototyping to being integrated into the company’s product (such as a RecSys on a shopping site). Therefore, in industry it’s important for candidates to not treat the ML models as mere curiosity projects—using as much data at runtime as possible and requiring too long to iterate on or no way to debug. That works fine on a research or ad hoc basis where the entire model is run only at rarer intervals. But in production, where an outage or bug could cause the loss of revenue or user trust, it’s important to prune some things and ensure the related scripts can be debugged. Articulating my opinion and experiences on this matter helped set me apart from candidates who seemed to not take any responsibility for the usability of their ML models downstream. For each role, the team’s maturity and the organization’s size will heavily influence what the day-to-day responsibilities of that job will look like (see Figure 1-3 ) and, in turn, how the interview questions are structured. Consider the following: you applied for two MLE roles, one in a large organization and one in a midsize organization where a new ML team is being set up. The large organization might have all of its CI/CD set up already, and all the automa‐ tions, version control, containerization, and orchestration have long been completed, so the MLE hire will focus more on maintenance and optimization. Therefore, the interview questions might focus more on whether you know common bottlenecks and how to resolve them. For the midsize organization where the ML team is just getting set up, the day-to-day role might be more about setting up the automated systems themselves, so you’d get more questions on how you work in an environment where you’ve set up something from scratch.'},\n",
       "   {'section': 'Model Monitoring',\n",
       "    'text': 'After the model is trained (via the process outlined in Chapter 4 ), you still have to deploy it to production. Before that, however, it is important to decide on and set up monitoring so that you can detect problems with the model in production as early as possible. For example, if the model is constantly rejecting loan applicants, you’ll want someone on the ML team to be looking into why and potentially bringing it up with the business or product team. Other types of monitoring to set up could include an alert when the data pipeline is failing and so on. In this section, I’ll cover common setups for monitoring, such as dashboards and data quality checks. I’ll also cover specific ML-related monitoring, such as accuracy data quality checks. I’ll also cover specific ML-related monitoring, such as accuracyrelated metrics. Job candidates who don’t have experience deploying ML models to production can mimic some of this experience by deploying some simple web apps, as mentioned earlier in this chapter. Here are a few common ways of monitoring ML models once they are live in production. Dashboards are often the first step in monitoring. You might not have automated data quality checks yet, but many companies I’ve seen have at least some sort of dash‐ board to monitor ML predictions. Here are some important considerations when you are creating dashboards for ML monitoring: Keep the visualization as simple as possible. If it’s too complicated, people will stop looking at it, which defeats the purpose of creating one. Make the labels as clear as possible. Team members I’ve worked with and mentored in the past know that if the labels aren’t there or aren’t clear in any visualization, I will mention their importance in a code review. In particular, please don’t forget the axis labels. Show patterns well. Sometimes the default scale can’t show the differences or magnitude well enough; for example, sometimes the graph gets very cramped. You can use log transforms to make a graph more readable. Some of these points aren’t determined during the interview but much earlier. For example, if you linked a GitHub portfolio on your resume, the interviewers might have looked at it. If the dash‐ boards or graphs on the portfolio are horribly unclear and lack axis labels, then that already gives a negative impression before the interview even happens. In terms of implementation, here are some common tools for visualization and monitoring: • Custom dashboards: Seaborn , Plotly , Matplotlib , and Bokeh • End-to-end platforms: Amazon SageMaker dashboards and Google’s Vertex AI monitoring • Other business intelligence (BI) tools: Microsoft Power BI , Tableau , and Looker Since dashboards are something to check manually, you may want to add automated checks to save time and ensure accuracy. These checks could include checking for missing values in the incoming data or even checking for a distribution shift in the data. Tools for data checks or data unit tests include: • Great Expectations (see Figure 6-3 ) • deequ • dbt (pipelines can include tests) Figure 6-3. Screenshot of Great Expectations’ Expectations, which can test if data ful‐ fills certain requirements. Now that you have automated the detection of data quality drops or shifts, you can set up alerts. An alert policy includes the logic for the alerts, such as: if the column starts having too many Null values, notify this Slack channel. Figure 6-4 shows an example of how a test would appear on Slack via Great Expectations . Figure 6-4. Screenshot of Great Expectations’ website: Slack notification example; source: Great Expectations documentation . Previously, I discussed overall monitoring setups and data monitoring, and now I’ll drill down on metrics that measure model performance itself, or the outputs and pre‐ dictions of the models. This is often asked in interviews to determine how you would handle model performance changes. Here are some categories of metrics to use: Accuracy-related metrics You can monitor and track accuracy-related metrics, although this might require the entire feedback loop to be complete. For example, in a churn-prediction model, you might predict that one user will churn during this month’s cycle. After a month, you then check if that prediction was indeed correct and do the same across all predictions in the month. If your model accuracy is lower than expected, then note that as something to investigate. Prediction-related metrics In cases where it’s important for the model to react more quickly than you have the feedback loop for, you can monitor the prediction metrics as well. For exam‐ ple, if the model starts to predict an abnormally high volume of fraud alerts (you can determine the threshold beforehand), investigate if anything has changed. Since you have data quality checks set up from the previous step, that can be a good starting point. In other words, use the output of the models as an alarm and troubleshoot it via investigating the inputs or other factors, such as recent world events or sales. As mentioned at the beginning of this section, the ML model aims to improve some‐ thing in the product itself, be it customer satisfaction, retention, or the like. Some‐ times, the highest ML accuracy might achieve an incorrect result. For example, a RecSys might accurately predict clicks, but it turns out that the content being recom‐ mended is clickbait or illegal. User satisfaction and trust will end up going down if this behavior isn’t quickly discovered and the model tweaked or replaced.'},\n",
       "   {'section': 'Overview of Cloud Providers',\n",
       "    'text': 'In this section, I’ll give an overview of the big three cloud providers. In ML inter‐ views, I don’t think it makes a big difference which one you have experience with, as long as you have awareness of how they work. As an example, my first job used local cloud, but my second job, which primarily used GCP, was fine with that experience since it demonstrated that I could work with remote machines. My third job used a mix of AWS and GCP and didn’t mind at all that I had only used GCP thus far, with small exposure to Azure. Once you get used to the main components, each big three cloud provider’s function‐ ality generally has equivalents. I still often find myself googling something like “GCP [terminology] AWS equivalent,” where [terminology] could be something like service accounts since they are called something else in AWS. I later found that they are sim‐ ply called IAM roles . Of course, an employer might expect the candidate to come in without much time to onboard and get used to a new technology, simple as it is. In those situations, the can‐ didate who has experience with the platform that the company uses could get prior‐ ity. I consider those situations to be something out of the candidate’s control and knowledge, and you shouldn’t feel too bad if you suspect a case like this. What’s more important than the specific tool name is knowing what the tool does. I tried to include the most well-known cloud services at the time of writing, but new things are often being added, so I encourage you to take a look at each services’ high things are often being added, so I encourage you to take a look at each services’ highlevel homepage to see what’s new. For example, Google Cloud Run only became available in 2019, 13 and Vertex AI was announced in 2021. 14 There are always more tools being built! GCP (Google Cloud Platform) is Google’s cloud offering. In my experience at multi‐ ple workplaces that use GCP, it’s pretty easy to use (in my opinion). The main tools I’ve seen in a data science/ML workflow are (this is a nonexhaustive list): Google Colab This is a popular solution for creating, hosting, and sharing Jupyter Notebooks. It can be used for R&D, exploratory data analysis, and model training. Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and buckets Used to store some inputs and outputs of model training. Google Cloud databases Includes Cloud SQL, BigQuery, Bigtable, Firestore, and so on. These are analyti‐ cal databases, sometimes used as a feature store for batch ML. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) For larger-scale operations, this tool uses Kubernetes to orchestrate the ML deployments like autoscaling when more compute resources are needed. Kubeflow on Google Cloud You can run tools for model management on GCP, such as Kubeflow, MLflow, and so on. Vertex AI At the time of writing, this feature is undergoing some updates and changes, but its purpose is to be an end-to-end ML solution. Of course, depending on the ML company you join, there can be a mix and match of tools since, at the end of the day, all these components are simply a means to an end. As I said before, you don’t need to know all of them; I’m mentioning some of these tools to help you gain general name recognition and get a sense of what each tool does. To get started with ML on Google’s tech stack for free, you can use Google Colab’s free tier, which is quite good, in my experience. Then, you can use GCP’s free tier , up to certain monthly quotas. Beyond that, there’s also a free trial up to $300 in Cloud Billing credits (available at the time of writing). Google provides a mix of free and paid ML courses; at the time of writing, here is their foundational courses page and their Machine Learning Engineer Learning Path . There’s also the Google Cloud Skills Boost : training services with video lectures and hands-on labs to GCP via Qwiklabs. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is another very popular cloud platform, owned by Amazon. It has a host of ML-related features and services; here is a nonexhaustive list: Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) Storage solution that can be used to store some inputs and outputs of model training. Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) Fully managed Kubernetes to orchestrate ML deployments like autoscaling when more compute resources are needed. Amazon EC2 Compute layer on AWS used to provision VMs. Amazon SageMaker Managed ML platform, model store, and feature store. It includes model version‐ ing , model monitoring dashboards , and more. To get started for free, use AWS free tier (available at the time of writing). AWS has official free lessons to guide you through the platform. 15 The AWS Machine Learning Learning Plan is also free (at the time of writing). I recommend getting a quick view via the official free courses first, since they are usually shorter, and focusing on what the providers themselves consider the most important parts to learn. Here is a nonexhaustive list of ML tools on Azure, Microsoft’s cloud platform: Azure Blob Storage Storage solution that can be used to store some inputs and outputs of model training Azure Virtual Machines The compute layer on Microsoft Azure Azure Machine Learning End-to-end platform for the ML lifecycle To get started, you can use the free services that are available on Azure. Azure has official free lessons on ML training on the Machine Learning for Data Scientists page .'},\n",
       "   {'section': 'Developer Best Practices for Interviews',\n",
       "    'text': 'During interviews, it’s useful to see if candidates have experience working in a proper software environment. For entry-level candidates, I expect to be coaching and men‐ toring them on the tools they haven’t used before. But I’ve seen a lot of people com‐ ing out of school who already have used tools like Git and have learned the process of getting code reviews in their school assignments or at their co-op intern placements, so to be realistic with you, the competition is pretty fierce out there. Even at the co so to be realistic with you, the competition is pretty fierce out there. Even at the coop/intern level, I’ve interviewed and mentored many candidates (for example, from the University of Waterloo, my alma mater) who have gained full-time-equivalent experience with the general developer tools described in this section. This section is very useful for anyone working in ML, not just those focusing on model deployment. Any job candidate for an ML position should have some experience using version control. Most commonly, version control is done with Git . Companies often use online platforms like GitHub or GitLab that support Git version control. The goal of version control is to be able to track changes to the code, roll back (reset) to a previ‐ ous version of the code, and collaborate easily with other team members. When you’re the only person working on the codebase (e.g., on your personal project), you might not see the point and instead use copy-paste to back up your code. However, when it comes to any larger codebase that two or more people work on, save yourself the headache and use version control. In my personal view, spending a little time upfront setting up version control pays for itself exponentially; without version control, you could waste hundreds of hours try‐ ing to pass code between multiple people or panicking when the code breaks and you can’t recover a past version that works. I’m shuddering thinking about it. If you want to gain experience with version control outside of work, you can get started by putting some of your code on GitHub or GitLab. But don’t stop with the initial code upload; try to learn to make changes with git-branch, git-commit, and so on. You can get started playing around with commands in the gittutorial. 16 In my experience learning Git, I learned the most from running the commands hands on. It’s normal to be pretty confused about the commands initially; don’t be afraid to test things out even if you’re not sure (back up your code by a local copy-paste just in case, though). If you’re afraid of messing up the code repository you’re working on for school or work, you can create a test repository that you can freely mess up and test the commands however you want. For ML roles that require the candidate to have strong software development skills, dependency management could be a topic of discussion during interviews. In devel‐ opment, it’s a best practice to use some sort of tool for portability, but at a more gran‐ ular, project level. This could be as simple as having set up Python dependency management, such as Poetry or Pipenv . The list is nonexhaustive, but it shows that you can keep in mind code portability and working together as a team to ship software/ML solutions. Knowing dependency management best practices ties in with the section “Docker” earlier in this chapter, where it’s useful to show that the candidate can integrate easily into a collaborative software development workflow with a team. When you make changes to production code at work, there’s often a review process during which other team members can give you feedback. You’ll need to demonstrate that the code works as intended and doesn’t break anything; tests are a common way to do this. Those who are new to the industry or fresh out of school are less likely to have gone through a code-review process. In the interview, this doesn’t matter too much, but one thing behavioral interviews can test is whether a candidate can take feedback well. This is to prevent friction after the candidate joins the team and is part of code review; people who can take constructive feedback well and not make it personal will be easier to work with. It’s out of scope for this book to talk more about ways to give and take feedback in code review, but I hope that you can see why some interview questions are designed to get an insight into how you might react in code reviews, a very common part of the ML/software workflow. To learn more, a useful starting point is the “Respectful Changes” page from Chromium Docs and the “How to Write Code Review Comments” section of Google’s Engineering Practices Documentation . As a cautionary example, I’ve seen candidates respond noncollaboratively and with aggressive defensiveness when probed about a mistake or misunderstanding in an interview. Recently, I heard of a candidate who even emailed to further criticize the interviewers and insult the company when they couldn’t answer the questions well. If a candidate reacts like that to a standardized, well-conducted, and professional one a candidate reacts like that to a standardized, well-conducted, and professional onehour interview, then how would they react to a code review? How would their coworkers who work day in and day out with that person feel if they can’t even han‐ dle one hour of interaction? It’s an easy way to not be hired, that’s for sure. In many coding teams, it’s a best practice to write tests for code. In Python, you can use packages like pytest and unittest (PyUnit). It doesn’t really matter which one you In many coding interviews, a hidden requirement is that you include tests for your code. This could be the case even if it’s not included in the description. For example, I’ve had live coding interviews on HackerRank or CoderPad that expected tests, but this wasn’t mentioned, and I also had a take-home coding exercise that expected the candidate to proactively add tests. Just to be safe, mention some test cases during your coding inter‐ view. The interviewer will usually expect you to at least mention it; if it’s out of scope to fully code out during the interview, they will let you know. If it’s a take-home exercise, I highly recommend writing some tests for it. On the interviewer side, I also expect interviewees either to ask if they should add tests or to proactively add them. Some interviewers who follow the same track as the software engineer interview track might even expect interviewees to use test-driven development (TDD) , 18 although I’ve found that to be rarer. If the interviewers expect something specific such as TDD, then they will mention it in their interview brief. Here are some resources for reading more about writing tests for ML workflows: • “How to Unit Test Deep Learning: Tests in TensorFlow, Mocking and Test Cov‐ erage” by Sergios Karagiannakos • “Getting Started with Testing in Python” by Anthony Shaw'},\n",
       "   {'section': 'Additional Technical Interview Components',\n",
       "    'text': 'As you saw in Figure 1-1 , there are additional interview types. Usually, they are more advanced components, assessing candidates on various combinations of ML, coding, training, and deployment (content that has been covered so far in Chapters 3 , 4 , and 5 and this chapter). Additional types that you might commonly hear about are: • Machine learning systems design interview • Technical deep-dive interview • Take-home exercises • Product sense I will briefly go through each of these interview types, so you are aware of how to prepare for them. I personally didn’t need to prepare for these types of interviews when I was looking for my entry-level role, as ML theory and coding were sufficient. However, I have encountered more and more advanced interviews as I progressed to senior and staff+ roles. Each company may ask for only some of these or none at all, so what you encounter in your interviews will differ. For example, Meta asks MLE candidates systems design questions, not just candidates at the “senior” level. ML systems design interviews and questions ask you to design something in an often hypothetical scenario. This could include asking you to design a brand-new system from scratch or how you’d hypothetically design a known system. Examples include: • “Imagine you are part of an ecommerce company’s ML team. It is aiming to use ML to increase customer retention. Walk through your initial approaches and how you would accomplish this.” • “How would you introduce ML-powered restaurant recommendations on Goo‐ gle Maps?” • “The online game our company is developing uses reinforcement learning to improve player experience. How would you design such a system?” ML systems design questions are often open ended, with plenty of back-and-forth with the interviewer asking follow-up questions that they find interesting. ML sys‐ tems design questions can be quite challenging for a couple of reasons: They likely don’t have a 100% correct answer. Since the questions are often about hypothetical scenarios, the questions them‐ selves might also change on the fly. For example, I (as the candidate) might ask the interviewer, “How many daily users are we expecting for this ML system?” Given the same question, by design the interviewer might not have defined all the parameters of the scenario and makes up a plausible number on the spot. Lots of what you do during the ML systems design is merely estimation and back-of-the-envelope math, and there is often no correct tool to choose (e.g., for some scenarios, you could use either XGBoost or CatBoost). ML systems design questions have high variance between each company, team, and interviewer. Much of your performance depends not only on your initial design but also on how you can respond to open-ended questions that could go in any direction. The interviewer could be curious about how you’d deal with the speed of the ML inference, and you could spend another five minutes on that topic. Or, by chance, they might ask instead about how you’d ensure that data quality is high before training the models. Treat it like improv and be able to adjust to how the conversation is flowing between you and your interviewer. Do yourself a favor and check the job posting to see what aspects you should focus on. Even in a scenario where the systems design questions ask you to design an end on. Even in a scenario where the systems design questions ask you to design an endto-end ML project, you can spend more time focusing on the core competencies of the position during the job interview. If you’re interviewing for a data scientist posi‐ tion that trains and evaluates ML models, then elaborate more on that and less on the deployment. Don’t ignore other aspects of the ML system if it’s an end-to-end system question, though. If you’re interviewing for an MLE position that focuses on deploy‐ ment, spend a little more time on that instead of getting stuck in a rabbit hole about data engineering. If in doubt, ask your interviewer if you’re focusing on the right thing and if they’d like to dive deeper on any topic. I won’t provide further examples here, since they would build on and combine the information from the ML algorithm, ML evaluation, ML deployment, and coding interviews that we’ve already discussed in this book. For entry-level roles, if there are systems design questions, they will focus on skills that have been covered in the pre‐ vious chapters. The most advanced systems design questions are mostly reserved for more senior and staff+ roles. For greater depth on this subject, I recommend the following resources: • “ML Systems Design Interview Guide” by Patrick Halina • Machine Learning System Design Interview by Ali Aminian and Alex Xu (ByteByteGo) • Search YouTube videos on example system design interviews for ML; this is a good example: “Harmful Content Removal: Machine Learning (System Design) Staff Level Mentorship” by Interviewing.io. (This question is aimed at the L7 staff position.) At Meta, example questions include “design a personalized news ranking system,” “design a product recommendation system,” and so on. As you can see from the fol‐ lowing breakdown, Meta is looking for an accumulation of the skills discussed in this book, not just a narrow subsection of them. The signals the interviewer is looking for from candidates include: Problem navigation Seeing if the candidate can organize the entire problem. Meta’s interview prep guide highlights that candidates should connect the problem to the business con‐ text. (Refer to Chapter 4 and the section “Product Sense” on page 214 .) Training data How would you collect training data and evaluate the risks? (Refer to Chapter 4 .) Feature engineering How would you come up with relevant features for the ML task? (Refer to Chapter 4 .) Modeling How do you justify choosing a specific model? Explain the training process, and explain the risks and how you’d mitigate them. (Refer to Chapters 3 and 4 .) Evaluation and deployment How do you evaluate and deploy the model? How do you justify which metrics to monitor? (Refer to Chapters 4 and 6 .) You can read Meta’s official resource in its software engineer ML full loop interview prep guide , which can be found on its careers site . In Meta’s interview prep guide, you’ll see repeated mentions of expecting candidates to come up with potential risks and mitigations for the ML designs they propose. This is a useful pattern of thinking for all ML interviews and a sign of a more effective and thoughtful ML practitioner. A useful and important way to improve your discus‐ sion of possible risks is to read about AI biases because they are a big part of risks. Research from Timnit Gebru and Joy Buolamwini are good resources; for example, they investigate ML algorithms’ accuracy disparities on gender and race (via skin type). 19 Meta’s own blog on progress and learnings in AI fairness and transparency also mentions various risks and mitigations. 20 Meta’s efforts include creating more datasets to “help researchers evaluate their computer vision and audio models for accuracy across a diverse set of ages, genders, skin tones, and ambient lighting conditions.” Technical deep-dive questions allow you to walk through something you’ve designed and built from scratch in the past, discussing the trade-offs and challenges you encountered along the way and how you addressed them. I have frequently seen this type of question grouped under behavioral questions that are related to past projects; for example, Shopify places a large emphasis on technical deep dives in its technical There are many companies that do this type of interview, and I’ve heard it called many names: case study interviews (different from the consulting type of case studies), reverse systems design, retro‐ spective systems design, and whatnot. I’m borrowing Shopify’s term, technical  deep dive , to refer to this kind of interview and interview questions in this book. Depending on the interview phase and the interviewer, answering this type of ques‐ tion can require more technical explanation and a deeper dive than the usual behav‐ ioral interview, and it has the depth and volleying that systems design has. However, it differs from the regular systems design questions with plenty of preparation mate‐ rial online since those questions focus on hypothetical situations instead of some‐ thing you actually built in a former job or project. Anecdotally, the more senior I get, the more questions I have gotten that are of the technical deep-dive variant. Here are important things to keep in mind while answering technical deep-dive questions: Justify and understand trade-offs in the system. Why did you choose BERT-cased over BERT-uncased? Why did you choose a basic Q-learning algorithm over a deep Q-network (DQN), or the other way around? Bring up analyses or benchmarks you ran during the time and be pre‐ pared to use them to justify your past choices. Deeply understand the main components you were responsible for. If you were responsible for training the model, be prepared to answer questions on the inner workings or even the mathematical foundations of those algorithms. For example, I’ve been asked how matrix factorization works, stemming from my project that used matrix factorization in the context of collaborative filtering. If you were responsible for the deployment infrastructure, such as in an MLE role, be prepared to answer more details on the Ops side. Sometimes, companies will provide an exercise or assessment for the candidate to do at home. These might be graded automatically, and a candidate would be passed or failed. There are also open-ended take-home exercises where the goal isn’t to pass or fail the candidate by the exercise alone but to combine it with an interview discussion where the candidate walks the interviewers through their solutions. The tips for ML algorithms and coding from previous chapters all apply: • Make sure you can not only explain the algorithms but also the trade-offs as well as why and how you decided on your approach. • Explain your thought process clearly to interviewers with docstrings in the code as well as verbally during the interviews. • Write tests! In data science and ML interviews, especially in big tech, a hidden requirement is that candidates possess some “product sense.” This is an umbrella term some companies use to describe whether a job candidate has practical knowledge on how ML benefits the company’s products. This can be shown when speaking about ML products and when you research the company’s products. It’s important to understand common product objectives for ML, such as: • Increase user convenience • Decrease user churn • Improve onboarding experience This is becoming more well-known nowadays; if you look up “data science product sense” on a search engine, some guides will show up. However, many candidates don’t think about preparing for this unless it’s explicitly mentioned by the recruiter or during the hiring process. As an ML candidate, you can integrate product sense into your behavioral interviews, systems design interviews, technical deep dives, and so on. The way you would prepare is to borrow from product manager interviews. From an interviewer’s perspective, I think of it this way. Does the candidate care only about model accuracy metrics, or do they also care about monthly average users of the product? Do they connect the ML they’re building to the product? Don’t underestimate this—when I was starting out in the ML field, much more expe‐ rienced people and successful peers recommended that I learn more about and understand the business side. This is one way that mentorship benefited my career: there is a lot of information that’s not shared in question-bank-type interview guides. In turn, I have included as much of that latent information as possible in this book. Here are some resources to get started: • “The Ultimate Guide to Cracking Product Case Interviews for Data Scientists” (Part 1) by Emma Ding • Exponent videos on product sense, such as this “Meta/Facebook Product Man‐ ager Mock Interview” • Cracking the PM Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell and Jackie Bavaro (CareerCup) Here are some interview questions I’ve used to interview MLOps engineers and MLEs who work on infrastructure. These interview questions include sample answers to help provide inspiration for your own potential responses. I want to point out that these questions mostly hinge on asking about your experience; most likely, the MLOps engineer and MLE will share the core coding interview loop ( Chapter 5 ) with other roles, and then the resume walk-through and technical deep-dive questions will include questions such as the ones I’ve given here. As I mentioned in Chapter 5 , those roles that are more focused on operations might also have more specialized coding questions that are similar to questions asked of DevOps engineers. At the risk of repeating myself too much, it is best that you double-check the job posting and with your recruiter and hiring manager, if possible, on the focus and expectations of the interview. For this chapter, it’s especially important to note that your answers will differ depending on your own experience; these answers are only high-level, relatively generic examples to show you what an answer might look like. Do not use them as a real answer in your interviews unless you’ve done the tasks/projects mentioned in the example answers. Example answer Using scaling on Kubernetes helped; for example, horizontal scaling helped dis‐ tribute the same workload across more instances. In cases when the heavy load came from request volume, I used load balancing with the Google Kubernetes Engine. In the past, I’ve used autoscaling features in cloud platforms, such as when I was working with GCP. Example answer For machine learning, I’ve learned that what’s different between monitoring an ML application in production as opposed to an application without ML is the data and model-related monitoring. This includes monitoring for data drift, model accuracy and drifts, and so on. For this, I use tools such as Great Expecta‐ tions or Alibi Detect . In particular, at my previous company we used Great Expectations to check for sudden large amounts of missing values or distribution shifts. In addition, using those monitoring tools, I can create alerts and have recurring anomaly-detection jobs on those platforms to report errors or drifts. On the ser‐ vice availability side (more general, less ML specific), tools such as Grafana, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana, aka Elastic Stack), and Prometheus are commonly used. Example answer I started by automating the steps involved in the ML pipeline, such as tidying up the scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Then I inte‐ grated those steps into a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins , triggering a pipeline run when there are changes to the code on our GitHub repo. This pipeline includes spinning up the environment, code linting, and testing, followed by automatic model deployment to a staging environment for further testing. Upon successful validation, the model is copied over to the production environment. These steps automated the deployment process, saving on manual deployment time and also allowing for quality control.In this chapter, I walked through the ML roles who might be interviewed on special‐ ized knowledge of their operations and infrastructure experience. Next, I discussed some levels and examples of end-to-end machine learning, which differ depending on the size and maturity of the data team. You also read about different types of cloud environments, trade-offs between private and public cloud, and common tools for ML model deployment and orchestration. I then discussed some model monitoring setups once the model has been deployed. I gave a brief overview of the popular cloud providers, noting that most cloud provid‐ ers have a similar toolkit, and if you use vendors that are not mentioned in this book, you’ll likely still find the equivalent services (just named something else). I brought up some developer best practices that are foundational for operations and software-heavy roles. Many of these things are naturally learned with work experi‐ ence, but for folks with school or bootcamp experience, you can still demonstrate these skills with group projects or open source contributions. Finally, I covered additional types of interviews for ML roles, such as systems design, technical deep dive, and product sense. In the next chapter, we’ll move onto behavio‐ ral interviews and how to succeed at them.'}]},\n",

       "  'title': 'Behavioral Interviews',\n",
       "  'content': [{'section': 'Behavioral Interview Questions and Responses',\n",
       "    'text': 'The goal of an interview is to gauge whether a candidate is suitable for a specific role, and that includes whether they can fit well with the team. No matter how amazing a candidate is at technical skills, they cannot deliver projects if they don’t collaborate well with colleagues to deliver said projects. The interview identifies a good candidate by several measures, with their ML/coding ability being important but not the entire picture that the interviewers are looking for. This chapter focuses on the interview questions designed to assess your fit on a team. To put it another way: there is a minimum requirement for technical skills, and can‐ didates at least need to know enough to clear the technical interviews. The bar is set here so that the hiring company is confident that the candidate can do a reasonably good job from a technical perspective. There is still variance among candidates who clear this bar; for example, some candidates might be expected to take slightly longer to onboard, but if the employer is expecting them to stay for a year or longer, slight differences in their programming skills aren’t expected to make a large difference in the long run. What then, separates all of the candidates who performed well in the technical inter‐ views? Interviewers depend on additional measures, such as how well the candidates can communicate, how well they can collaborate with colleagues, whether they respond well to feedback, whether they have a growth mindset, and so on. For instance, a candidate who has decent technical skills that clear the bar, coupled with strong communication skills, may perform better in the end than a candidate with very strong technical skills that clear the bar by a large margin, but who is insuffera‐ ble to work with. Generally, as long as you are self-aware and use common sense in your modes of communication, your interview evaluation won’t be affected. My point is: an easy way for a candidate to fail interviews is to show that they’re difficult to work with. The hiring team knows that people who are arrogant, not self-aware, and so on are likely to be a net negative to the team and, therefore, not a good hire. To measure all those factors that are not measured by the technical portions of the interviews, interviewers use behavioral questions . Behavioral questions can be asked in dedicated behavioral interview sessions, although they can also be asked during technical interviews interspersed with the technical questions. The terms “behavioral question” and “behavioral interview” may vary from region to region or from indus‐ try to industry. Generally, this type of interview will be about what is commonly referred to as soft skills . It’s important to understand that possessing these soft skills directly affects your ability to contribute technically to an ML project, unless you run something like a one-person startup. Here are some examples of what behavioral interviews and questions measure: • Communication skills • Collaboration and teamwork • Leadership skills • Conflict-resolution skills • How the candidate responds to feedback • How the candidate deals with uncertainty and learning new technologies/tools • Whether the candidate is aware of how their technical work contributes to the business/products the hiring team is building—sometimes referred to as product sense The questions might follow formats like these: • “Tell me about a time when you…” For example, “Tell me about a time you navi‐ gated conflict within an ML project you were working on.” • “Describe a time you dealt with a tight deadline and how you responded to it.” • “What’s an example of a successful presentation you had to give about an ML project, and what was your preparation process?” The goal is to measure how you would act as a colleague based on your responses describing how you reacted to a similar situation in the past. Note that behavioral questions are often about your real past experiences; do not confuse them with hypo‐ thetical situations, such as, “If you had a conflict on your team in some fictional sit‐ uation, what would you do?” Hence, it is important to treat preparation for the behavioral interview as a crucial part of your ML interview preparation. You should start by taking an inventory of your past projects, past work experiences, and other relevant experiences. Note down some past experiences at work, volunteering, or school that you are proud of. These will serve as a foundation when you prepare for behavioral questions. You’ll refine the topics on this list as we proceed through this chapter. In ML interviews, and in tech interviews in general, a well-known technique for structuring answers is the STAR method. 1 Having a structure ensures that you give the interviewer enough context, including a description of the situation you experi‐ enced in the past and the impacts of your actions. The STAR method is detailed in Table 7-1 . Table 7-1. The STAR method Here’s an example question and answer, with the answer following the STAR method: Question “Tell me about a time you ran into tough blockers [business speak for situations that cause progress to be blocked] on a project. How did you push past them?” Answer [ Situation ] I was working on project Y, which is to create a recommender system for our company’s shopping website. [ Task ] I was responsible for training the machine learning models to generate recommendations for users of the shopping site. [ Action ] I collaborated with data engineering to gain access to the required data and started training a baseline model with XGBoost. In the process, I identified new data sources that would be beneficial to the models, and in the end, I iter‐ ated on two types of models: one that performed better on newer users and one for existing users. [ Result ] The models were run online and compared against a control group in an online experiment. In the end, the ML-powered approach gained a 2x lift in engagement metrics over the baseline control group. Here’s what this answer did well: • It avoided too much jargon. • It mentioned the lift (improvement) of the ML models compared to the control group. As an interviewer, I feel that more detail could have been given about the shopping site, but in a real situation, it’s likely that the contextual information was covered in earlier questions where the interviewee already described their responsibilities in this project. In addition, as an interviewer, I will ask follow-up questions on points I want to learn more about, such as “What were the two types of models you trained?” Sometimes, using the STAR method isn’t enough, especially when candidates follow the template robotically, making the answer to the interview question dry and unmemorable. I suggest using the hero’s journey method to enhance answers con‐ structed with the STAR method. The goal is to further describe the challenges you overcame and the immense efforts you made to succeed in the situation, thus making The hero’s journey, or monomyth, 3 is a common story template that involves a hero who sets out on an adventure and undergoes various trials and tribulations. Finally, they emerge victorious and return home changed or transformed. Some examples in mainstream media include The Lion King , The Hunger Games , and Star Wars . When you think of those films, what part of the story do you remember the characters going through the most? It is usually the journey and the challenges they overcame rather than the initial scenes that set up the world and backstory or the final few scenes when the hero has returned and there are celebrations. The structures of the films are also roughly set up this way: they might set the context with 15–20% of the scenes, spend 60–70% on the journey and challenges, and then take the final 10–15% for the uplifting and triumphant conclusion. Of course, this structure varies from story to story. The main takeaway I want to highlight is that a good chunk of time is spent on the journey and challenges. That is why I suggest incorporating this structure on top of the STAR method. An exciting story with this format, as shown in Figure 7-1 , will emphasize the description of the challenges encountered during the adventure, along with the original catalyst and the result. Figure 7-1. The hero’s journey for behavioral interview questions. Now, I’ll walk through an example of an answer to a behavioral question that isn’t very memorable or impactful, despite following the STAR framework. Recall the example interview question in the previous section: “Tell me about a time you ran into tough blockers on a project. How did you push past them?” I walked through an example answer using only the STAR method; here is an exam‐ ple of how to make this answer even better with the hero’s journey: [Situation] I was working on project Y, which is to create a recommender system for our company’s shopping website. [Task] I was responsible for training the machine learning models to generate recom‐ mendations for users of the shopping site. [Action] I collaborated with data engineering to gain access to the required data and started training a baseline model with XGBoost. [Hero’s journey, emphasis on challenge] While training the XGBoost model, there was a catch: the model wasn’t perform‐ ing that well overall. I analyzed the results to find out further steps to investigate; the quality of the data sources was correct, so I ruled out a data quality issue. The dataset consisted of anonymized customer features, such as when they last accessed the shopping site and the values of their last purchases. However, the model wasn’t able to capture further nuances of customer behavior because it wasn’t in the data. I suggested that I’d need more telemetry data about customer behavior to my manager and the senior developer on the team, and they pointed out the clickstream dataset that I could use. After incorporating the new data, there was still some way to go. The new models were performing well on new customers but not as well on existing customers. Hence, I split out the data and used two models separately for each type of user depending on their account age, which was able to achieve the best overall performance. [Result] After I presented the detailed results of the model training to various senior members on the team as well as the product team, the models were approved to be run online. They were compared against a control group in an online experi‐ ment. In the end, the ML-powered approach gained a 2x lift in engagement met‐ rics over the baseline control group. I recommend practicing saying your answers to various behavioral questions out loud (you can find some examples in this chapter). When faced with real interviews, it’s easy to freeze up and forget the STAR method or hero’s journey. I recommend prac‐ ticing with friends, and some peers have had good experience practicing on platforms like Pramp , which pairs you with a stranger for mock interviews (there are both free and paid options). Here are some of my comments as an interviewer on the example answer, which are also general best practices: Describing the challenges you overcame helps build the interviewer’s confidence in you as an interviewee. As an interviewer, this answer, which adds the hero’s journey method onto the STAR framework, describes much more about the challenges the interviewee faced when developing the ML models than the first example answer did. Why is this important to the interviewer? This type of answer can better exhibit that you are an employee who can dig yourself (and even your team) out of holes, and if you describe the depth of the hole (challenging situation) you’ve encountered in the past, the interviewer can be more confident that you can do the same if you join their company. Challenges leave a stronger impression. In addition, as an interviewer, when I hear and understand the extent of the diffi‐ culties the candidate encountered, I can better remember them. This also serves as an easy way to explain to coworkers why I’m vouching for this candidate, as opposed to candidates where everything seemed like smooth sailing for them. The interviewee who didn’t describe their challenges in detail might have actually solved a more difficult problem than the interviewee who did, but (1) I wouldn’t know, and thus (2), it leaves a smaller impression, and it’s hard for me to describe it to my colleagues during a candidate-review survey. Explain interactions and collaborations, giving credit when it’s due. This answer not only paints a better picture of the situation and challenges but also mentions the interviewee’s teammates. Interviewers might get curious about whether the interviewee has skills involving cross-team communication, or at least communication with their manager or immediate peers. Because of the interview’s time constraint, the interviewer might not have time to explicitly ask about the scope of the team. At worst, interviewers can become suspicious when the interviewee doesn’t bring up any collaborators, due to patterns of interview‐ ees claiming work that is not their own. Explain the context and any specific terminology that the interviewer might not know. A common mistake I’ve seen job candidates make is to jump right into the prob‐ lem too quickly and not explain the context. When speaking to someone who works in the same company as you, expecting your coworker to have a certain level of familiarity makes sense, and you can often skip the explanation of what a word means. But as is often the case in interviews, you’re likely speaking to someone at a different company. Instead of saying, “I was working on the ML model for MyShopping,” say, “I was working on the ML model for MyShopping, which is the mobile app that customers can use to browse the store pages and make payments for their purchases.” For interviewees who have not had work experience but are describing a school project, beware of using terms from your school without explaining them. For example, at the University of Toronto, com‐ puter science classes are labeled as CSC, such as CSC 110Y1, but at the University of Waterloo, they are labeled CS, such as CS 115. Explain any acronyms to your interviewer even if you think it should be easy to figure out what you are refer‐ ring to. Provide comparable technologies that are familiar to the interviewer to explain terminology. Don’t assume that everyone remembers the names of technologies and what they do. For example, when mentioning Trino, you can also mention that it used to be called Presto before it was rebranded. Or, if you are explaining how you used Airflow in a past project, you can mention that Airflow is a platform for creating and managing data workflows. In addition, you can mention that it has some similarity to MLflow or Dagster, and so on. Even better if you know that the company where you’re interviewing uses a certain tool or technology and you use that technology to explain the way you used your tool, such as, “I was using Airflow, in a similar way to how you folks mentioned you use MLflow, which is…” In my experience, this connects very well with interviewers, and they know that I have been paying attention to our discussions and that I have researched their company beforehand or asked informative questions when on the call with their recruiter. Adjust the level of detail depending on the audience. It is important to be able to explain technical and nontechnical concepts with various levels of detail. In some interviews, namely the on-site final round, you might have an interview session or two with stakeholders like the product manager you’d be working with or the director of an organization that the ML team works closely with. I’ve encountered sessions like this, usually one hour each, in my experience interviewing for ML jobs. For interview sessions with product-oriented folks, I focus more on how my technical work ties into the product or how it affects the business rather than going down a rabbit hole of why I chose a certain ML evaluation metric. As an extension of this rule, when you are talking to interviewers who work directly in ML, still provide some con‐ text. For example, I don’t have much experience with computer vision in my day job and will need to be reminded of certain acronyms in the computer vision space. It’s possible that your interviewer needs a bit more explanation of rein‐ forcement learning, if that’s the domain you primarily have experience in, but the company or team you’re interviewing for doesn’t focus on it. During behavioral interviews conducted by people who are ML experts, you should still provide context. One way to frame this is to remember they work for another company/team and that they might be an ML expert in another domain. As illustrated in Figure 7-2 , it doesn’t just matter how much you know or how good your skills are; if your communication during the interview isn’t getting through to the interviewer, then they won’t know all your strengths and all the value that you can bring to their team. Spending time polishing up how you can use your communi‐ cation as a conduit during the behavioral interview to help the interviewer under‐ stand you more has a very high ROI. Figure 7-2. Communication during the interview is essential; if you can’t communicate well, then no matter how brilliant your skills, that won’t get across to the interviewer.'},\n",

       "    'text': 'Now that I’ve walked through how to structure your answers to behavioral interview questions, let’s dive right into some common questions. 1. Tell me about a time you had to help a teammate or colleague not on your imme‐ diate team understand a piece of code or design. How did you approach the situation? Interviewer’s perspective : one thing to think about is if the candidate tried to make their explanation from perspectives other than that of coworkers on their own team—for example, by providing more context. 2. Tell me about a time you had to present to nontechnical stakeholders. How did you prepare, and how did it go? Interviewer’s perspective : asking a candidate how they prepared gives me, as an interviewer, better insight into what they value and whether they are observant about possible communication gaps. In addition, by asking how they prepared, it gives me insight into how they fill in perceived gaps in order to make the presen‐ tation a success. 3. Describe a time when you dealt with a frustrated teammate or manager. How did you handle the situation? Interviewer’s perspective : it’d be nice for the candidate to bring up how they tried to resolve the conflict and how they approach situations where they’d need to meet in the middle. Their response to this question might also help me estimate how easy they are to work with in a tough or high-stress situation. 1. Tell me about a time you made a mistake and how you handled it. Interviewer’s perspective : it’s useful for me to learn how a candidate manages sit‐ uations like making a mistake. Do they hide it at all costs? Do they make a situa‐ tion worse by letting the consequences of the mistake build up? Or do they own up to the situation and come up with a solution? When you answer questions like this, try to communicate to the interviewer that you value collaboration and communication. 2. What was a time when you had a difficult conversation about a project? It could be with a teammate or person you are mentoring. Interviewer’s perspective : of course, this question also touches on the communica‐ tion aspect. From the teamwork aspect, I think it’s useful to see if the person is the type to take ownership and responsibility as well as to find ways for the team to work better despite this difficult conversation and situation. 3. Tell me about a time you led a project. Interviewer’s perspective : this is a free-form question, and answers can touch on some important aspects of a senior-level role. For junior folks, this is a good question to see how you treat your team members as a leader. 1. Tell me about a time you received critical feedback. 2. What do you value the most about giving and receiving feedback? Give me an example for each. 3. If you were to change any decision you’ve made in the past, what would it be, and why? If you really are coming up blank for a question, it’s OK to let the interviewer know that you need a few moments to think. My template for situations is this: “I’m taking a few moments to gather my thoughts for this question.” I’ve never met any inter‐ viewer who had an issue with the candidate asking for a moment to prepare their answer. When I am interviewing others, I also respect the time, and I notice (anecdo‐ tally) that candidates who jump right into answering are more likely to have mean‐ dering answers. Taking a pause can help you perform much better, and it takes only a few seconds! 1. Tell me about a time where you dealt with high pressure, such as a tight deadline, and how you got through it. 2. Tell me about a time when you were unhappy with your job or project. What did you do to make the situation better? Is there anything you would have done dif‐ ferently, looking back? 3. In the past, have you needed to learn a new programming language (or other new skill) for a project? How did you ensure that it was effective? Walk through an example. Interviewer’s perspective : it’s important to clarify the time frame and how what you learned contributed to the project. Bonus points for sharing the methods you use to get unstuck and recognizing when to ask for help. These are important skills for tech workers, not just in ML, as recognizing how to unblock yourself (including asking others after trying available solutions) can demonstrate a proactive approach to avoiding project delays. This is not a clear-cut standard, but from my experience, it is not most important to be the “know-it-all” but rather to be someone who embraces a “beginner’s mind” and learns quickly. This is essential to a long career in ML, and tech in general, since tech‐ nologies change very quickly year over year. There are many types of behavioral interviews, and it’s impossible to memorize answers for all scenarios. I prepare a list of three to five past projects and reuse them for different situations. For example, I mentored and onboarded new team members onto a RecSys project in the past. I can use that example for leadership questions as well as communication-related questions. Then I prepare another scenario that I gen‐ erally use to answer “how I dealt with a difficult situation” or “how do I deal with feedback” questions. Overall, I don’t really use many scenarios, and I can quickly pivot a past scenario to fit the question that’s asked. My advice is to treat interviews like improv and be able to adjust on the fly, instead of fully memorizing any answers. Memorizing can potentially sound unnatural. 1. How are you thinking about your career, and does the job posting fit your goals? Interviewer’s perspective : the company wants to make sure your interests align. If the job doesn’t interest you, it’s more likely you’ll leave sooner—that is, you’re a flight risk. 2. Do you have some knowledge about the company, product, or team? Interviewer’s perspective : spend 10 minutes reviewing the company website, a list of its products, and the job posting before the interviews, just to refresh your memory as part of interview prep. 1. Tell me about a time you built something from scratch. 2. Could you walk through the project you’re most proud of? Note : these questions can be part of a technical interview, but they require a good behavioral interview structure to answer well. 3. Have you ever used data to improve a process or technology? If you really don’t have an example that the question is asking about—for example, the question assumes you have mentored someone, but you have not formally done so—you should be truthful about what you think instead of making something up on the fly. What works for me is saying: “I don’t really have an example of that scenario. However, I’ve helped onboard a teammate; could I talk about that experience?” Or: “Do you mean formally mentoring someone? I haven’t been part of a formal pro‐ gram, but I have helped onboard and teach a new teammate about our codebase. Would that work?” 1. What excites you at work? 2. What are some hobbies you have outside of work?'},\n",
       "   {'section': 'Behavioral Interview Best Practices',\n",
       "    'text': 'Now that you’ve seen some example questions, here’s a summary of best practices for when you’re answering behavioral interview questions: I recommend reviewing the example questions and best practices when you are preparing your interview answers to help make sure you’re covering your bases. Make sure to pause occasionally during a longer answer or explanation. Don’t ramble on forever without giving your interviewer a moment to interject with questions. Now that more and more interviews are being conducted virtu‐ ally, it is especially important to pause now and then so that your interviewer can respond. This helps create more natural conversation if you can’t see the inter‐ viewers’ body language. Quickly summarize your interpretation of the question for the interviewer. This can help check if you’re understanding the question correctly and gives the interviewer a chance to correct any misunderstandings before you spend a lot of time answering the wrong thing. It takes a few seconds to summarize your understanding, but it can save minutes! In addition, I find that this creates a few moments for my brain to think, instead of trying to answer the question the second after it’s asked. Of course, if you notice that you are truly running low on time, you can skip this. Clarify with your interviewer when in doubt. As with the previous point, this is to make sure you’re not going down a rabbit hole when you’re unsure about something. I’d rather be safe than sorry and ask. Some folks avoid asking questions because they’re worried it will make them seem unsure or unconfident, but I’d argue it’s the opposite: by not confirming if you’re still on the right track, it might give the impression that you are too high you’re still on the right track, it might give the impression that you are too highstrung to ask questions. A simple “Should I continue to talk about my approach to the model training, or did you want me to move on to the model evaluation?” should suffice. Interviews are communication. In interviews, the general rules of communication apply. Don’t be rude (for no reason), don’t put people down or ignore interviewers, and be professional. See one example of ignoring interviewers that should be avoided in Figure 7-3 . Figure 7-3. Quote via Tweet from Gergely Orosz ( full thread ). Find a way to use your past experience, no matter what it is. You can find a way to connect your past experience with why you’re here, at this ML job interview. Some people may think that mentioning their non-ML or non-tech skills is stretching the truth, but I feel that in many different fields, the transferable skills are very important. Having a self-directed project, not just something where everything was handed to you, shows that you’re, well, self-directed. This requires additional work, but you can make your own experience by defining your own project, such as a web app that serves ML predictions. You can break down the tasks required to build it and execute on them. These are often called side projects and don’t require you to pay thousands of dollars or take another online course or bootcamp. You can use this experience to answer a good number of technical and behavioral questions. You can certainly bring in transferable communication and leadership skills. If you’ve managed a kitchen, worked service jobs, or been a cashier, there are likely some memorable stories that serve as answers to behavioral questions like “tell me about a time you encountered a difficult situation at work.” Don’t ignore what you have. Once I had a mentoring call with a PhD candidate in English who had self-learned an impressive number of Python skills and was wondering how to showcase their skills formally. I recommended the same thing that I did myself: find a way to shoehorn data science or ML into a self-directed academic assignment. Being in the English program, they could easily find ways to apply NLP techniques within a formal school project. This amounted to hitting two birds with one stone: a great project to show‐ case on an ML resume that also counted for academic credit. In my case, I used Python any chance I could for econometrics assignments during my master’s degree studies, which was allowed (the options were to choose among Stata, R, or other tools). I had to go out of my way to do it since most of the instruc‐ tional material was in Stata or R, and I googled how to translate instructions in those programs into Python. As you can see, this was great for answering not only technical questions but also behavioral questions on learning new skills and challenges I encountered. ML interviews for senior roles and higher levels, such as staff or principal, will also have behavioral interviews. I’ll use “senior+” here to refer to those roles. The founda‐ tions of answering those questions generally follow all the principles in this chapter, but I’d like to point out certain differences. Job titles and levels aren’t standardized in the tech industry, as shown in Table 7-2 . But as a rule of thumb, after the senior level come the staff and principal levels. At some companies, there might be only staff or only principal, or sometimes principal comes after staff, or it could even be flipped. Table 7-2. Example of different titles in different tech companies as of 2019, from “The Career Path of Software Engineers and How to Navigate It” , a presentation by Nikolay Stoitsev, engineering manager at Uber For each company, you can check levels.fyi as an unofficial source—emphasis on unofficial; it’s still best to confirm with someone within the company, organization, or team. Senior+ interviews will emphasize whether you can differentiate yourself from an entry-level hire, and you must demonstrate that in the interview. Examples of what a senior ML contributor will be responsible for include: • Can you complete projects independently, and lead a team to do so? • Are you able to find answers and unblock yourself in more difficult situations? • Are you able to mentor junior teammates? • Do you understand the relationship between your organization and the product your company is building, and can you leverage that to succeed? • Are you able to collaborate well with other teams and, in addition, build trust with stakeholders? To succeed at interviews for senior+ roles, your answers to the interview questions will differ from those you prepared for an entry-level role. For example, at entry level, there might have been someone who assigned tasks to you, and it’s OK if you didn’t understand the entire rationale of why the API you were building helped the product. But at the senior level, your questions will be held to higher standards of independence as well as idea creation (understanding the underlying reasons) and being able to be a multiplier for the team by helping everyone be more productive. For staff and principal roles, you’ll need to demonstrate all of the above, but at an even higher magnitude. Seniors might collaborate with their immediate team and a handful of adjacent teams, while staff+ jobs require building trust and relationships with the larger organization and other organizations. For example, staff+ roles may collaborate on a major product that the company produces with marketing, finance, product, and so on.'},\n",

       "    'text': 'If you are interviewing for some big tech companies, there are known ways to pre‐ pare. You’ll need to put in additional effort to ensure your answers fit, but it will be effort well spent. Knowing that each company has something it values makes it necessary to tailor your behavioral interview questions. For example, I went out of my way to make sure one of my commonly used behavioral interview questions for leadership could also cover the “Bias for Action” principle in the Amazon Leadership Principles. The following are some examples. Amazon will tell every ML/DS interviewee to learn about its Amazon Leadership Principles and to demonstrate enough of those values in the interview. At the time of writing, some of these principles are: • Customer obsession • Ownership • Invent and simplify • Learn and be curious • Insist on highest standards • Think big • Bias for action • Earn trust • Have backbone; disagree and commit • Deliver results I recommend checking Amazon’s official page for the most up-to-date principles, as new ones are occasionally added. Here are some example questions and related principles: Insist on the highest standards Tell me about the time when you raised the bar/standards of the team/project. Learn and be curious Tell me about a time when you made a better decision due to your curiosity. Ownership Tell me about a time you went above and beyond your normal responsibilities. Note that these questions are similar to those asked elsewhere, but if you’re inter‐ viewing at Amazon, map them to the closest Amazon Leadership Principle and make sure that you touch upon the principle in your answer. Meta has Six Core Values . At the time of writing, they are: • Move fast • Focus on long-term impact • Build awesome things • Live in the future • Be direct and respect your colleagues • Meta, Metamates, me To repeat the tips I previously mentioned, you’ll have to weave these principles into your behavioral questions responses: you’re not just listing them out. Meta has five signals to assess during the behavioral interview. These are: • Resolving conflict • Growing continuously • Embracing ambiguity • Driving results • Communicating effectively As usual, I recommend that you look at Meta’s official pageto see the most up-to to see the most up-todate information on its core values and culture. A recruiter at Meta recommended looking at the resources on the Meta Career Profile (which you can create a profile for when invited to an interview). Publicly available resources recommended on the Meta Career Profile include: • “Interviewing at Meta: The Keys to Success” • “Software Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer: Full Loop Interview Prep Guide” • “Five Ways to Grow Your Career at Meta” • “Embracing Change to Evolve Her Engineering Journey” • “Opportunity and Trust: Growing an Engineering Career at Facebook” Google famously tries to gauge its interviewees’ “Googleyness” 5 and has an “About” page post titled “Ten Things We Know to Be True” that lists several values important to Google. Googleyness supposedly doesn’t have one simple definition, but here is an example. Laszlo Block (former head of People Operations at Google and author of Work Rules ! ) defined “Googleyness” as: Additional resources include an article from Business Insider  that outlines 13 qualities that Google looks for in its employees . In addition, traits like the ability to think logi‐ cally, role-related knowledge and experience, and leadership will be important to weave into your behavioral interviews . 6 . Netflix has its “culture deck” . On the “Jobs and Culture” website are listed a few important values Netflix holds as a company. At the time of writing, they are: • Valued behaviors (such as courage, communication, inclusion, etc.) • Honest, productive feedback • Dream team • Freedom and responsibility • Informed captains • Disagree then commit • Representation matters • Artistic expression For more elaboration on each of those points, I encourage you to look at Netflix’s official web page , which includes details on each of these values. This is a nonexhaustive list of examples, but the hope is that you can see how to pre‐ pare for each different company. For each company, big or small, I recommend you do a quick search of its careers page to find out if there are values listed out like this; they could be in the rubric the interviewers are evaluating you on! Spending the time to research this information is also an easy way to “guess” one of the guaranteed questions. For example, at Elastic (Elasticsearch), the values are called the Source Code . In interviews, we ask if candidates are aware of it, and if so, which point in the Source Code is their favorite. A company that was acquired by another might use its new parent organization’s rubrics. For example, when I was interviewing for Twitch (acquired by Amazon) a few years ago, Twitch recom‐ mended that I also look at the Amazon Leadership Principles, which was seconded by an Amazon employee I spoke to. Note that this might vary from team to team. Ask your recruiter when in doubt.In this chapter, I discussed various ways to structure responses to behavioral inter‐ view questions, namely the STAR method and the hero’s journey. Next, we looked at common categories of behavioral interview questions, with example questions for each. Then, we looked at various best practices for behavioral interview questions. Finally, we went over best practices for big tech, including specific examples from Amazon, Meta/Facebook, Alphabet/Google, and Netflix. I concluded with some tips on how you can tailor your behavioral interview answers to other companies.'}]},\n",

       "    'text': 'Table 8-1 includes a sample roadmap that you can reference while creating your own. Try writing down the overall plan but know that it’s not set in stone. I recommend adjusting your plans on a weekly basis. Start by setting achievable goals within your target time frame. For example, if you want to read a nine-chapter ML book in a week, you’ll need to aim for completing 1.3 chapters a day. Breaking down the tasks to the chapter or practice-question level can help you see at a glance what’s feasible and what is not. At the end of the first week, if 1.3 chapters a day proved to be unrea‐ sonable, you can expand your timeline or spend more hours per day on preparation. If you were able to breeze through two chapters a day, you can adjust some of your projections on how much to read during the second week. In Chapter 5 , you filled out a roadmap for programming prepara‐ tion, which I felt was important to include separately because of the muscle memory and repetition that coding-interview preparations require. This chapter’s roadmap focuses on the overall interview process, so it’s a good time to add in any other ML-related study and preparation planning. Table 8-1. Example roadmap; hours: between classes/assignments and evenings, two to three hours per day Use the template in Table 8-2 to fill out your own roadmap. Take into consideration your other life commitments and energy. How many hours each day are you setting aside?

       "    'text': 'In addition to writing about machine learning and tech careers, I’ve written about efficient time management and productivity since 2017. These are great skills to have in life, and they allow me to achieve more in less time. With the right time manage‐ ment skills, you can spend more time with loved ones, doing chores, playing video games, and enjoying life, all while hitting your career goals. It’s no different with interview preparation. Everyone wants to do more with the same amount of time or less. Competitors for the same ML job who are disciplined, efficient, and effective with their interview preparation will likely secure the positions over those who aren’t. Here are the main tips I use to excel at learning, which I will discuss more in detail in the following sections. These tips are beneficial not only for preparing for interviews, but also for acclimating quickly to a new job and for getting fast promotions: • Learn quickly by getting hands-on as soon as possible. • Understand the system. • It’s not about a shorter time frame but progress per time spent. • Recursively seek out knowledge gaps. Learning by osmosis doesn’t work. Just watching endless YouTube videos or reading more Reddit posts and books won’t work. I say this because I’ve done it before. It’s fine to relax while doing surface-level browsing and reading, but if you want to move the needle, get hands-on as soon as possible in parallel to learning. Code a small neu‐ ral network. Do a LeetCode question without looking at the solution. Figure out what you don’t know and fill in that gap. Rinse and repeat. When I was studying for the CFA Level 1 exam, I did mock exams before I finished reading all the materials. I’d get only 35% correct, but it helped me rapidly identify which materials I should read more and which I could skip altogether. Standardized exams test how well you know the materials as well as how well you know the systems and structures of the exam itself. Even native English speakers fumble the IELTS (International English Language Testing System) exam if they don’t prepare at all because they’re caught off guard by the question format. If you try to study for a university exam without looking at the course syllabus, you’ll be at a severe disadvantage. In fact, you probably wouldn’t prepare for an exam at school without checking the syllabus first. Job interviews are the same. Lots of candidates don’t take detailed notes on what the recruiter says is going to be asked in the next rounds, and they don’t follow up. I try to construct as detailed a picture as possible by asking clarification questions: “When you say coding interview, is that general Python, like LeetCode style, or focusing on data manipulation, such as with pandas?” I’ve mentioned doing more with less. This doesn’t mean I prepare for interviews in only a week while others take two weeks. Let me explain efficiency with a ratio: pro‐ gress made toward goal / time spent. If I’m spending five hours, that five hours better count. I don’t enjoy doing some‐ thing in ten hours that I could have done in five (though it happens). For people with a very limited amount of time to themselves each day, such as one hour, then it’s even more important to increase the efficiency. Don’t compare yourself to someone who has much more time available and can complete their preparations in a week. Instead, with your one hour a day, focus on the right things, and you may be able to achieve your goal within a month’s time instead of letting the time balloon to three months. Compare yourself to yourself and focus on your own time availability and your own goals. Don’t waste time but do increase your efficiency when possible. As you were reading this book, you might have come across terminologies you didn’t fully understand. The same applies when you’re researching for new job roles. Instead of ignoring these terms, note them down and learn the definitions. The next time you come across that term, you won’t have the same question again! Here’s an example of iteratively filling in knowledge gaps when encountering a new term or technology, ChatGPT: ChatGPT GPT models: while reading up on these, came across the new term transformers Transformers: reading up on this, came across the new terms encoder/decoder and self-attention • Encoder/decoder: read up on this, seem to understand it for the most part • Self-attention: read up on attention , seems to make sense The goal is to dig as deep as you can until it ties back into the knowledge that you already have or until you acquire the knowledge. This is why foundational knowledge is important: you can use that building block to connect knowledge with new con‐ cepts for better understanding and knowledge retention. Preparing for interviews is often an exercise in optimizing the results with con‐ strained resources (time, energy, etc.). Good time management can help you maxi‐ mize your outputs with the same amount of time spent. Accountability can help you do what you planned to do. Here are some tips on time management, which I will discuss in greater detail in the following sections: • Block out time to focus. • Use the Pomodoro Technique. • Avoid burnout. • Ask yourself: do you need an accountability buddy? I recommend blocking out time on your calendar specifically for interview prepara‐ tion and protecting that time. Let’s say you have Thursday evening after work blocked out to prepare—if some friends ask you to come out for a beer, you should probably say no, but you’ll catch them next time. OK, unless it’s a friend from out of town you see only once a year—then move Thursday to Friday; don’t just forget about it! I personally like blocks of one hour or more, ideally two to three hours since my brain takes 30 minutes to warm up. The essential thing is to block the times in advance as much as possible. If you try to block the time on the day of, it’s much eas‐ ier to let procrastination sweep you away. Here is how the Pomodoro Technique for time management works: • Set a timer (the default is 25 minutes). • Don’t do anything apart from the task at hand during that time. Checking social media, reading unrelated emails, and the like are all not allowed. (Looking up terminology or websites directly related to the task is allowed.) • After the timer is done, take a break (the default is five minutes). • Repeat. The reason I like setting a timer is because it increases the efficiency (progress per time spent). If I’m spending an hour on preparation, I might be able to complete two practice questions. If I’m fiddling on my phone or distracted, I might only complete one practice question in one hour! That’s half the efficiency I could have had if I had just set a timer. Obviously, this can affect the amount of time required to prepare for interviews. If you haven’t tried using a focus timer (Pomodoro) yet, I highly recommend you give it a try to greatly increase your efficiency. If you’re more of a go-with-the-flow person, and you’ve tried out timers and they don’t work, then go with what you know works for you. In many cases, it’s worth sharing your progress with someone, even if they’re not pre‐ paring for interviews with you. I found that when my peers were working hard on interviews when I was in school, it was easy to also work harder, even if we weren’t interviewing for the same companies. If you’re preparing on your own, it’s possible that in isolation, it will be more difficult to keep up your motivation. In that case, here are three options: • Keep track of as much as you can on the roadmap and be your own accountabil‐ ity buddy. • Tell a friend or family member about your progress. They don’t have to know too much detail unless you want them to. • Join study groups online in your community (e.g., alumni group). • If you have hired a career coach, they can help you with accountability. I’ve personally had great results with being my own accountability buddy. Having a visualization of my roadmap and calendar and filling it up feels great. I also like play‐ ing video games, so maybe something about being able to see the progress is very sat‐ isfying to me. The downside is that since I’m the only one in the know about my progress, I can start to procrastinate and keep adjusting my timelines: one week becomes two, becomes three… because there’s no one who knows. In the case of telling someone about your progress, it’s easier to find someone around you who you can update. Here’s an example of something you can send to a friend: “I’ve been preparing for interviews. Mind if I send you a quick message about it every week? You don’t have to respond in detail. I just want to have some accountability.” My friends have always been OK with this. At the end of a week, I might message them: “I did pretty well this week. I finished the two chapters and 10 questions I plan‐ ned to do. However, I’m three questions short of the goal, and I’ll do that next week.” You can try out different methods to see what works for you. As in the case of work‐ ing out at home or at a gym, this is something that differs for each person, and you’ll have your own strategies for how to get your preparation workouts in. The reason why the Pomodoro Technique has time built in for breaks is genius. It’s not just time management—it’s also energy/focus management. Do you ever have those moments where you’re working on a math problem for hours and you’re really stuck? But then you go take a washroom break or a walk, and when you come back, you magically realize how to do it? This happened to me a lot when I was practicing LeetCode questions and would get stuck. I’d take a walk to clear my mind and come back to tackle the problem after being refreshed. Better yet, just call it a day and go to sleep. When I was in grad school, I called this the “sleep technique.” Sustained practice, via breaks, is the best way to avoid burnout. In an extreme exam‐ ple, if you let yourself burn out, you could be losing weeks or months of motivation. I’ve been there before—a few times—and it’s not great; it set back my goals for a while because I couldn’t get energized or motivated since I worked myself to the point of burnout when I was younger. It took months to recover. Our bodies aren’t machines, and our brain gets tired after long usage. Take care of yourself and avoid overworking yourself if you can. Much like myself, though, I suspect that many peo‐ ple might not learn their limits until they actually reach them, and that’s fine too. As long as you keep it in mind!'},\n",
       "   {'section': 'Impostor Syndrome',\n",
       "    'text': 'You may have heard the adage “Job postings are wishlists, not requirements.” 1 If you are a person who is generally hesitant about applying for jobs where you meet about 60% of the qualifications, I encourage you to try applying to some of them. You may get better results than you had been expecting! If you are hesitant about jobs where you meet most of the qualifications and instead apply only for jobs you’re overquali‐ fied for, take a step back and consider if this could be related to impostor syndrome . Remember that in a company with enough resources (i.e., midsize and up), the more entry level the job is, the more the team will expect to spend time to onboard and mentor you. I’ve also experienced severe impostor syndrome, 2 and felt like I was not actually qualified for jobs (even jobs I was currently doing). One thing I’ve learned is to zoom out and look at the big picture. Who am I comparing myself to that is making me feel inadequate? Am I actually comparing myself to a broader group of people than I should be—for example, people with many more years of experience? If I’m surroun‐ ded by peers who all seem smarter than I am, perhaps that’s a good thing rather than a bad thing (a phenomenon I experienced studying at a highly competitive master’s program). I recommend reading Eugene Yan’s blog post on the same topic for tips to identify and manage impostor syndrome. 3 It’s not something that will just go away; maybe it won’t ever fully disappear since as you move up in your career, there are always new things to learn (and to feel like an impostor about!). In short: • You might be comparing yourself to a broader group of people who are doing better for reasons such as more years of experience. Stop comparing yourself to others like that or frame it as a good thing. • Write down a list of your own accomplishments and reflect on them often. YouIn this chapter, you saw a summary checklist and roadmap for your own interview preparations. You also read about learning efficiently, managing time better, and avoiding burnout.

       "    'text': 'Since you’ve read to this point in the book, I hope you can apply what you have learned to your job search! It can be a game of persistence: while interviewing for one of my past roles, I applied to around 70 openings, and I got 10 recruiter interviews and two final-round interviews, which led to an offer. The interviews spanned several months, during which I kept running into new scenarios and questions. You might have the same questions along your interviewing journey. Let’s say you’ve gotten some interviews, and you’re eagerly awaiting their response. What should you do at this stage? Of course, the ideal outcome is that you can smoothly move to the next stage, but statistically speaking, there will be times where you hear the unfortu‐ nate news that the hiring team has moved on with other candidates. What should you do in this situation? In this chapter, I will go through the final steps, from post-interview to offer stage, covering FAQs that I’ve gotten from job candidates. I will lay out some scenarios that I’ve personally dealt with and that many job candidates have dealt with, too, and I will share advice to arrive at the best outcome. I’ll also go through some tips for your first 30/60/90 days at a new ML job, to set yourself and your ML career up for success! After the interview, I’m often just ready to relax and forget about it. But here are some actions I try to do (most of the time) after each interview to optimize my job search. To be honest, sometimes I don’t complete every step, but I know that if I do them most of the time, that increases the chances that I will improve at job interviews and land that job! I like to take notes of what I remember of the questions and roughly how I respon‐ ded. This helps me see what types of questions are being asked and if there are com‐ mon patterns. An additional step you can do with this information is double-check the questions by googling resources like Reddit or Glassdoor to see if they coincide with what other candidates have been asked, and sometimes other job seekers will share how they answered. I find that some companies with a very set interview process commonly reuse ques‐ tions. But for companies that have more conversational interviews or give a take tions. But for companies that have more conversational interviews or give a takehome exam, it’ll be harder to tell. Either way, if you can see ways to improve your answers on interview questions after the interview, that will help you perform even better if you encounter the same question or a similar one next time. It’s easy to neglect this step, but if the next interviewer asks a similar question and you answer it poorly (again), causing you to fail the interview, wouldn’t you really regret that? Ask the recruiter or hiring team what the next steps are and what the time frame is for when you should expect to hear back. Sometimes, the answer is that they don’t know how long it will take, but that is valid, too. Just make sure you ask, whether during the interview, as a follow-up email, or in a call to the recruiter or hiring team. I’ve been asked this question a lot, and when I was starting my first job, I also asked a friend/mentor about whether I should do it. As an interviewer who has now conduc‐ ted many ML interviews, I’d say it doesn’t really make a big difference. Sure, a simple and casual note is nice to read, but I’d say that the interview results really hinge on if the interview itself went well; a good thank-you note won’t change your performance. As a candidate, I do sometimes send a brief thank-you email. Now that I have experi‐ enced the other side as an interviewer, I know that they don’t really make the candi‐ date stand out too much. I have yet to meet someone on the interviewing team who’s found simple, polite thank-you notes to be annoying, but if I ever get a follow-up note that’s rude, then I’d rather the candidate didn’t send anything at all. If you really want to send a thank-you note, I suggest the following: • Keep it short and simple. • You can reiterate your excitement about the role. • Do not try to explain away some mistake you made in the interview or be defen‐ sive about something. The interviewer might already have forgotten about it, and this only does more harm than good. One suggestion to job seekers from a hiring manager is to not go the opposite direc‐ tion and seem too desperate, such as by sending a very lengthy thank-you email that is overly thankful. Examples include exaggerations such as “This is an opportunity of a lifetime” or “It would be the greatest privilege to work for you.” In an ideal world, the interviewer would take the email at face value and not judge the “desperateness” aspect of it, but in reality, these things do play a role. In your region, there may be other social norms that affect how verbose people are in professional correspondence or how much gratitude you show. I have worked for Canada- and US-based com‐ panies so my communication norms are North America centric. Do adjust accordingly! Here’s my personal interview thank-you note template—you should substitute the words in the brackets [ ] with your own situation: From a CTO and hiring manager in the fintech ML field: “One time after an inter‐ view, we received a long diatribe from the interviewee calling us unprofessional and that it was a waste of time.” The interview process was a standard process that the company conducted, with hun‐ dreds of candidates having gone through it, and the interview had multiple interview‐ ers in that call. This candidate also seemed quite upset in the email that they weren’t able to answer the questions, as well as exhibiting other rude behaviors. This inter‐ viewee was immediately dropped from the interview process. Ideally, you’ve already been told when to expect a response from the recruiter and/or interviewers. If you haven’t heard back, and they haven’t told you when to expect a response, I think it’s good to follow up after one business week. Some companies really do take months to hire, especially if the company is very large and bureaucratic. So even if you email after a week, they may not be able to give you a proper response right away, but at least you’ll have started the post-interview conversation. Some companies also take only a week or less—those are usually startups.'},\n",
       "   {'section': 'What to Do Between Interviews',\n",
       "    'text': 'If you have a few interviews lined up, you may have some time in between several of them, whether that’s between multistage interviews or interviews with different com‐ panies or for different roles. Or this could be the time after you get some responses, but you haven’t accepted an offer yet. This is a fluid length of time, so you don’t need to focus on separating the difference between “post-interview” and “between inter‐ views,” as there is some overlap. When I’m a job candidate myself, I know that rejection is an inevitable part of the process—getting those “unfortunately, we have decided to move on with other candi‐ dates…” emails. When it’s a job I’ve been really hyped about and I anticipated a posi‐ tive response, I give myself some time to feel upset and (reasonably) vent to trusted individuals, such as my friends or family. Generally, there’s no reversing the situa‐ tion, apart from being polite and professional. It’s possible for a candidate to be a sec‐ ond pick, and if the first pick rejects the offer, you could be contacted again. But that will likely not happen for candidates who send an angry follow-up email. You don’t have to respond to a rejection if you don’t feel like it, but especially for teams I interacted with more during the interview process, I will send an email as a courtesy since I already got to know those people. I often don’t send an email back after an automated rejection email. However, if the email is from a recruiter after I’ve spoken to them or after I’ve passed more interview rounds and actually interacted more with the team, I will email to respond to a rejec‐ tion. If I do, here’s my template: Note : I usually add more (the optional additional sentence) only if I made it to the later rounds where I got to meet the team and had good rapport with them. I might also say something like “Let’s keep in touch!” if I feel that we had good rapport. But I think this really depends on your personality. As usual, replace the text in the brackets [ ] with your own situa‐ tion and keep in mind if your region values other types of commu‐ nication, as I’m writing from a North American perspective. A fellow ML professional mentioned that this is also when they ask for feedback (if applicable), and sometimes they do get it from the hiring team. I myself rarely have especially when it’s a big company with processes to follow. When responding to rejections, it’s best to stay professional, polite, and positive. In my experience, I don’t get interviews for all the jobs I apply for, so it doesn’t hurt to apply to more jobs that fit my ML skills and profile. As to whether you tailor the applications or not, keep in mind your effectiveness per application that was men‐ tioned in Chapter 2 . Even if you feel that you are a little bit unqualified, still apply! Often, a successful can‐ didate may not even have all the experience on the list. For example, I’ve seen many ML job descriptions mention Kubernetes, but as you’ve read in previous chapters, not all ML roles require in-depth experience in Kubernetes. Of course, you do still need to fit a good amount of the expected experience or successfully persuade the hir‐ ing team that you are able to learn and contribute in a reasonable period of time. You might have read or heard about this statistic: men apply for a job when they meet only 60% of the qualifications, but women apply only if they meet 100% of them. 2 This might be one of the ways that confidence manifests in fewer job applica‐ tions from qualified candidates. If this is relatable to you, definitely take a look at whether you’re underselling yourself. So if you’ve received that dreaded rejection email, keep building that application fun‐ nel. Keep applying, keep browsing, and keep updating your resume! Use each rejec‐ tion to help you increase your chances next time; otherwise, you may be spending more time than you need to on the process. Each time you reach out for a referral, it won’t always result in an interview. And not every interview will result in an offer. I’ve shared more about this in Chapter 2 as well as in a blog post, “Why Networking is like Investing in an Index Fund” , detailing how I met two final-round interviewers at the director level merely by attending some meetups and conferences. Networking and referrals are great ways to increase your effectiveness per application. If you have the spare time and energy to go to just one event a month (or even every two months), it can really add up. I set a low-pressure goal to meet one new person per event. This is a long-term strategy, but sometimes you can reach out to folks for a job you’re applying for and get a response if you made a good impression. Refer to Chapter 2 for some examples. Sometimes, your resume really will make a big difference in reducing initial rejec‐ tions. I’ve given people resume feedback before, and they’ve reported that the call‐ backs have increased. I’ve personally used this strategy when applying for different types of ML roles. Improvements to my resume have increased the number of inter‐ views I received for jobs that were heavier on ML model development, and they also helped me avoid interview invitations for jobs that didn’t match my skills. As mentioned in Chapter 2 , tailor your resume to the specific ML role you want; for example, for MLE, check if you should emphasize your ML model development skills or your Kubernetes skills. If you have space on your resume, you can emphasize both.'},\n",
       "   {'section': 'Steps of the Offer Stage',\n",
       "    'text': 'Now that you’ve gone through a few interviews, hopefully, you’ve gotten an offer! Even if your first offer might not turn out to be your ideal, I think it’s a massive mile‐ stone. The first one can be the hardest! Sometimes, the timelines of other interviews are more delayed, but if you let other companies know that you’ve received an offer, there are places that are willing to expedite your interview process. Of course, this isn’t guaranteed, but there is no harm done in letting other places know you have an offer. The best case is they’ll expedite your process, and the worst case is that there’s no change. These companies also now know that another company wants you; that could increase your value as a candidate since you have current external validation. I don’t cover much on negotiation in this book, so here are some articles that many have found useful: • “Salary Negotiation: Make More Money, Be More Valued” from Kalzumeus Software • “Exactly What to Say When Recruiters Ask You to Name the First Number… and Other Negotiation Word-for-Words” from interviewing.io I’m going to be very honest here: a new job is a big career and life move, and it isn’t something to trivialize. I often need a week—or a weekend at the very least—of unin‐ terrupted time to think about the offer. Sometimes, you don’t have the luxury of time and need a job immediately, and that’s OK, too. Here, I’ll outline my thought process when it comes to responding to an offer, assuming you are not in an urgent financial situation, in need of a visa quickly, or in some other type of personal situation. In those cases, you will probably have your own considerations for accepting a job offer, and the considerations I give here might not apply to your situation! I personally ask for as many days as possible to decide—ideally, at least over a week‐ end. Let’s say that you got an offer on Tuesday and they want a response by Thurs‐ day, but that’s not enough time for you to research all the details and compare the offer. Here are some examples of what you can say: • “I need to discuss the offer over the weekend with my family. Can I get back to you next Tuesday?” • If you are still interviewing with other companies: “I need some more time since I’m also at the final stage of another interview. I’m very glad for the offer, and I’m very excited about this opportunity, but it wouldn’t be right if I didn’t double-check with the other company about their final details, too. I think I can know their decision by next Monday. Can I keep you posted by next Wednesday?” • If you are relocating: “I want to take a little more time to research the area and cost of living before I can make a decision on this offer. Could I get back to you next Tuesday?” Depending on your situation, there are many real and important reasons for you to do your due diligence and take some time before you sign the dotted line on a con‐ tract that could drastically change your day to day. Before making any decisions, I highly recommend understanding your offer holisti‐ cally. The following are some aspects that might not come to mind immediately but are very important parts of your job offer, beyond the obvious base salary. Workplace culture is described as “a collection of attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that make up the regular atmosphere in a work environment” by Indeed. 3 Work takes up a lot of time in our lives: at eight hours a day (not including transportation, if applica‐ ble), five days a week, about 24% of our week is spent at work. If we assume eight hours of sleep a day, and there are 16 waking hours in a day, then we spend 36% of our waking hours at work. So if the workplace culture isn’t a fit with you and your values, the result could be mental and physical health issues that take a lot of money and time to fix. Is the ROI worth it? Is it worth your life? Sometimes, it’s hard to figure out what the real workplace culture is during the inter‐ view phase, but keep it in mind. Healthy workplace cultures could include behaviors like being fair, collaborative, and transparent, but unhealthy workplace cultures could foster bullying, discrimination, or illegal conduct. In North America, there are protected classes, 4 laws that aim to protect against discrimination for a list of classes, such as race, age, sexual orientation and gender identity, veteran status, religion, and so on. 5 As a personal example, I am a relative minority in North America, and there are people similar to me who I know who have encountered hostile workplaces, so it’s personally important to find companies with a work culture that is against sexual and gender-based harassment. An important question to ask yourself when assessing the offer is: can you spend time with those who are important to you? There’s a saying that “20 years from now, the only people who will remember you worked late are your kids.” There are also cases where people lament missing their kids’ important milestones (like their first steps or other culturally important milestones) because of inflexibility at work. If you don’t have kids, then substitute other loved ones 6 like parents, a significant other, your pet… you get the idea. The same logic can be extended to hobbies, such as creating art, socializing, going to music festivals, and the like. Avoiding burnout is also important. Burnout is defined as “a syndrome conceptual‐ ized as resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully man‐ aged” by the World Health Organization, with effects including “feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion.” 7 In the long run, the cost of burnout is probably higher than the temporary benefit of overworking. People often regret ruining their health, be it mental or physical, for work. On the other hand, I have known someone who poured themselves into work as an escape from other things. There are also people who strongly believe in the com‐ pany’s mission and own more equity in the company, so working harder will give them more mental and financial fulfillment. Depending on your situation, evaluate these points of your job offer accordingly. This is the most obvious part of the offer: the monetary amount that you can see in your bank account every time you get paid. Base pay is often treated as one of the most important parts of an offer, and rightfully so—money pays the bills and bails you out of catastrophic life events; it’s harder to do that with fewer liquid funds. For example, if you have restricted stock units (RSUs) in a public company, there are blackout periods 8 for selling the stock, so you can’t liquidate in the case of an emer‐ gency. Of course, if you have more savings, then it’s fine to have less liquid base pay coming in. (More examples of non-base-pay options are discussed next.) For some regions, you can check Glassdoor or levels.fyi for average compensation. Do keep in mind that there might not be enough data for your specific situation, so take the numbers with a heavy grain of salt. For example, since I am Canadian, those sites don’t often have enough data for me, and I get most compensation info by word of mouth from my mentors and network. Yes, people will share exact dollar figures if they trust you. Yes, you have to spend time to build that trust (refer back to Chapter 2 ). Some companies may give you other kinds of compensation beyond base pay. Com‐ pensation you may commonly see includes RSUs, stock options, year-end bonuses, profit sharing, commissions, and so on. Be sure to check the value of these. For exam‐ ple, options are not the same as RSUs. At a previous workplace, even though I had a lot of options, they happened to end up being worth $0. Some things you’ll want to understand in an offer include the vesting period for stocks or options, how to exercise options, and so on. I’m not a financial expert, so you can read more about this in “Everything You Need to Know About Stock Options and RSUs” from the Harvard Business Review. Check online guides and/or ask an expert in your region for specific rules, laws, and taxes relevant to your area and employment situation. Your benefits might not be included in the base salary, but they could have a lot of monetary value. For example, I didn’t even realize my company had contributed more than $10,000 to a retirement fund via employer matching in a year. I was aware of the employer matching but didn’t actually calculate the dollar value when consid‐ ering the offer. In hindsight, I absolutely should have. In the US, good health benefits could literally mean thousands of dollars of savings for you. Maternity and parental leave could represent great peace of mind for you and your family. Depending on your life stage, the list of relevant benefits could change with time. A personal example is that I didn’t care much about health and dental benefits when I was younger, but after I started needing regular maintenance on a specific dental pro‐ cedure, paying 20% of the treatment became more costly than paying 0% of it (my previous two jobs, respectively). My advice is to not underestimate the benefits. Now that you’ve taken a holistic look at the offer, think about what accepting the offer would mean for your life and career. I recommend always double-checking with the recruiter or hiring manager if you want to clarify anything. They already exten‐ ded you an offer, and at this stage, they would rather answer your questions and adjust the offer (if reasonable) than spend dozens of hours on the interview process for another candidate. So don’t worry about taking some time to look over the con‐ tract, ask questions, and do your due diligence. I’ll share a personal example here. I accepted a job offer where the hiring recruiter verbally mentioned an additional compensation component (on top of base pay) in my offer. However, it wasn’t actually in the signed contract, and I naively assumed it would sort itself out. Fast-forward a few months, I finally asked about the compensa‐ tion, and it turns out it was a mistake that it had been left out of the contract. This could have been avoided if I had asked the simple question before signing the con‐ tract! Thankfully, in my case, my manager quickly rectified the issue, but I may not have been so lucky without written proof. In addition, it might not have worked out if the hiring manager had left the company or if I had been assigned to a new manager in the meantime.'},\n",

       "    'text': 'So, after a lot of hard work going through the interview process, you’ve gotten an offer, or even a few—congratulations! Now you’ve accepted your job offer of choice and are starting the job! There are lots of things you can do beyond onboarding that can benefit you during the first few months of your ML job. My formal education didn’t teach me these things, and sometimes even past job experience won’t make you aware of these help‐ ful tips. The following actions have helped me greatly in my past jobs, and I think they are important to keep in mind during the first few months of your new ML job: • Gain domain knowledge. • Gain code familiarity. • Meet relevant people. • Help improve the onboarding documentation. • Keep track of your achievements. Now I’ll walk through the details of each of these actions. If you’re a data scientist in banking, you’ll onboard and learn about the banking products you’re working with and how they work. If you’re an MLE in ecommerce and recommender systems, you’ll need to make sure you understand what the cus‐ tomers value and what the business values. If you don’t understand these points well, you might end up developing models or infrastructure that don’t fit what the com‐ pany is trying to optimize for, making your job performance seem poorer than it actually is. On the other hand, understanding the goals well will help you build ML more effi‐ ciently. Who knows, this could make the difference in how long it takes for you to get a promotion (if you’re aiming for that)! I think this is the action that is least overlooked, as in an ML role, it’s pretty much a guarantee that you’ll be onboarded to the code and data or receive some training. But for the sake of completeness, here’s what I make sure to do: • Be able to set up the development environment. • Check the permissions that are required and request them (or ask a manager to request them). • Skim through the main projects and code repositories. If there are libraries you aren’t familiar with, ask a coworker if they are being used. If they are, then you can ask your manager if there’s part of the onboarding process that trains you on those. The reason why I mention checking first is because lots of com‐ panies and teams have some legacy code that might not need to be changed, and thus you don’t have to worry too much about it. For example, at one of my workplaces, a few folders and jobs ran on Scala, and I checked with my manager if they were being used because I was curious. It turns out that those jobs were being phased out, so I didn’t need to worry too much about them at the time; focusing on familiarizing myself with the Python and shell scripts was more important. Companies are made up of people, even in tech where we work with code and machines. On the technical side, reach out to your principal, staff-level colleagues and other peers who are responsible for similar technical aspects as you. This can help when you are stuck on something because you know whom to reach out to to get unstuck. For example, as a result of reaching out to people early on as a new hire, I became much more effective at my job. When I didn’t know how to track down a data source, I had a Rolodex of people to message or a list of documents to read (that were written and sent to me by humans). If you are working on a specific family of products, such as a recommender system on a social media feed, then know who is making decisions about the product. Reach out to the product manager or relevant person(s). Don’t underestimate reaching out to nontechnical folks; sometimes you are stuck not because of a code or data issue or a bug but because of some product logic that you didn’t know. As a new hire, set up 30-minute coffee chats (virtual or in person) with people on your team and organization. This can help you get to know them and onboard faster as they can share important context with you. Once you finish a coffee chat with someone, ask who they suggest you meet with next. You can then set up a coffee chat with that person! During onboarding at all companies I’ve worked for, there were always documents to follow and sometimes meetings with a coworker or manager to walk through the code, data, and projects. On documentation webpages, there can sometimes be bro‐ ken links or outdated descriptions that your onboarding buddy tells you about ver‐ bally. Make a change to those docs; it’s a great way to start contributing, and if your documentation is stored in a code repository (e.g., Markdown files on GitHub that are rendered on an internal Wiki page), then it’s an easy pull request (PR) you can make in your first week, or even on your first day. As you get settled in, keep your long-term growth in mind. This means noting down anything you’ve done in preparation for performance reviews and promotion pro‐ cesses. One great resource is Julia Evans’ brag document , which is a document where you keep track of what you’ve accomplished at work. Update it regularly, and it will be a great resource for the future you as you keep making your way in the ML field!In this chapter, I discussed some post-interview FAQs such as following up, respond‐ ing to rejections, and so on. I also walked through the common considerations and components of a job offer, which I hope can provide perspective. Next, I provided some tips for when you start your first ML job to help you succeed during the first few months. Congrats on making it this far! Now I hope you can put what you’ve learned into practice. If there’s one thing I want for you to take away, it’s for you to learn to adjust and find your own footing. It’s like bouldering (I don’t even really boulder): when you grasp another handhold, the way you keep balance and grip will be different from how someone else does because they have different leg strength and different grips ( Figure 9-1 ). And this ML career is the boulder we’re all on, tackling in our own way. Best of luck; I’m rooting for you! Figure 9-1.

       "  'text': 'In the first part of this chapter, I’ll walk through the structure of this book. Then, I’ll discuss the various job titles and roles that use ML skills in industry. 1 I’ll also clarify the responsibilities of various job titles, such as data scientist, machine learning engineer, and so on, as this is a common point of confusion for job seekers. These will be illustrated with an ML skills matrix and ML lifecycle that will be referenced throughout the book. The second part of this chapter walks through the interview process, from beginning to end. I’ve mentored candidates who appreciated this overview since online resources often focus on specific pieces of the interview but not how they all connect together and result in an offer. Especially for new graduates 2 and readers coming from different industries, this chapter helps get everyone on the same page as well as clarifies the process. The interconnecting pieces of interviews are complex, with many types of combina‐ tions depending on the ML role you’re aiming for. This overview will help set the stage, so you’ll know what to focus your time on. For example, some online resources focus on knowledge specific to “product data scientists,” but will title the course or article “data scientist interview tips” without differentiating. For a newcomer, it’s hard to tell if that is relevant to your own career interests. After this chapter, you’ll be able to tell what skills are required for each job title, and in Chapter 2 , you’ll be able to parse out that information yourself from job postings and make your resume as relevant to the job title and job posting as possible. This chapter focuses on helping you differentiate among various ML roles, and walks through the entire interview process, as illustrated in Figure 1-1 : • Job applications and resume ( Chapter 2 ) • Technical interviews — Machine learning (Chapters 3 , 4 , and 6 ) — Coding/programming ( Chapter 5 ) • Behavioral interviews ( Chapter 7 ) • Your interview roadmap ( Chapter 8 ) • Post-interview and follow-up ( Chapter 9 ) Figure 1-1. Overview of the chapters and how they tie into the ML interview process. Depending on where you are in your ML interview journey, I encourage you to focus on the chapters and sections that seem relevant to you. I’ve also planned the book to be referenced as you go along; for example, you might iterate on your resume multi‐ ple times and then flip back to Chapter 2 when needed. The same applies to the other chapters. With that overview, let’s continue. The companion site to this book, https://susanshu.substack.com , features bonus content, helper resources, and more.',\n",

       "  'text': 'First, let’s walk through a brief history of job titles. I decided to start with this section to dispel some myths about the “data scientist” job title and shed some light on why there are so many ML-related job titles. After understanding this history, you should be more aware of what job titles to aim for yourself. If you’ve ever been confused about the litany of titles such as machine learning engineer (MLE), product data sci‐ entist, MLOps engineer, and more, this section is for you. ML techniques aren’t a new thing; in 1985, David Ackley, Geoffrey E. Hinton, and Terrence J. Sejnowski popularized the Boltzmann Machine algorithm. 3 Even before that, regression techniques 4 had early developments in the 1800s. There have long been jobs and roles that use modeling techniques to forecast and predict. Econome‐ tricians, statisticians, financial modelers, physics modelers, and biochemical modelers have existed as professions for decades. The main difference is that there were much smaller datasets compared to the modern day (barring simulations). It was only in recent years, just before the 21st century, when compute power started to increase exponentially. In addition, advances in distributed and parallel computing created a cycle in which “big data” became more readily available. This allowed practitioners to apply that advanced compute power to millions or billions of data points. Larger datasets started being accumulated and distributed for ML research, such as WordNet, 5 and, subsequently, ImageNet, 6 a project led by Fei-Fei Li. These collective efforts laid the foundation for even more ML breakthroughs. AlexNet 7 was released in 2012, achieving high accuracy in the ImageNet challenge, 8 which demonstrated that deep learning can be adept at humanlike tasks at a scale that had not been seen before. Many ML practitioners see this as a time when machine learning, deep learning, and related topics increased by leaps and bounds in terms of recognition from the broader population, not just the AI community. The recent popularity of generative AI (such as ChatGPT) in 2022 and 2023 didn’t come out of nowhere, nor did the deepfakes, self-driving cars, chess bots, and more that came before it; these applica‐ tions were the results of many advances over recent years. “Data scientist” as a job title began as an umbrella term, when the ML and data fields were less mature. The term “data scientist” on Google Trends , which measures the popularity of search terms, surged in 2012. That was the year when that article was published by Harvard Business Review: “Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century.” 9 By April 2013, the search popularity of “data scientist” was already tied with “statistician” and subsequently surpassed it by magnitudes, as shown in Figure 1-2 . Back in those days, there wasn’t a narrow divide between infrastructure jobs and model training, though. For example, Kubernetes was first released in 2014, but companies have taken some time to adopt it for orchestrating ML jobs. So now there are more specific job titles for ML infrastructure that didn’t exist before. Figure 1-2. Search popularity for the terms “data scientist,” “machine learning engi‐ neer,” and “statistician” on Google Trends (retrieved August 9, 2023). As social media, web recommender systems, and other modern use cases increased, companies started gathering much more granular data, such as clickstream data , which is data collected as a user browses a website or app. Another recent advance‐ ment is an average corporation being able to store the sheer amount of telemetry from machines and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Previously, data scientists may have worked with data that was updated weekly or daily. Now, as many applications update more frequently or in real time, more infrastructure is needed to serve ML functionality in web products and apps, so more jobs have been created around those functions as well. In short: as the machine learning lifecycle grew more complex, more job titles were created to describe the new skills that a full ML team now requires. I’ll elaborate more on the job titles and ML lifecycle later in this chapter. All of this happened within the last decade, and companies don’t always change their job titles to reflect how the roles have become more specialized. Regardless, as a can‐ didate, knowing this history can help reduce confusion and frustration from applying for a job and finding the role is different from another company’s job with the exact same title. See Table 1-1 for previous trends in ML-related job titles and Table 1-2 for current trends in ML job titles. Table 1-1. Previous trends of ML and data job titles Table 1-2. Current trends of ML and data job titles With that history to explain why you will encounter different job titles, I’ll elaborate on each of these job titles and their responsibilities.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Here is a nonexhaustive list of job titles for ML (or closely related) roles: • Data scientist • Machine learning engineer • Applied scientist • Software engineer, machine learning • MLOps engineer • Product data scientist • Data analyst • Decision scientist • Research scientist As I discussed “A Brief History of Machine Learning and Data Science Job Titles” on page 3 , each role is responsible for a different part of the ML lifecycle. A job title alone does not convey what the job entails. As a job seeker, be warned: in different companies, completely different titles might end up doing similar jobs! As illustrated in Figure 1-3 , your ML job title will depend on the company, the team, and which part(s) of the ML lifecycle your role is responsible for. To give specific examples of how job titles can depend on the company or organiza‐ tion that is hiring for the job—based on real people I’ve spoken to, job descriptions, and job interviews—the person responsible for training ML models but not for build‐ ing the underlying platform might be called the following: • Software engineer (ML) or data scientist (Google) • Applied scientist (Amazon) • Machine learning engineer (Meta, Pinterest) • Data scientist (Elastic, the team where I work) • Data scientist (Unity) Figure 1-3. What’s in a machine learning job title? By the time this book is published, any of the job titles within these companies and teams may have changed. Regardless, it demon‐ strates the point that ML titles may vary between companies and even between different teams in the same company. The job title also depends on the organization, the department, and so on. Some departments in Google have the data scientist 12 job title, and some don’t. At the com‐ panies where I’ve worked, my teams had data scientists train ML models while MLEs built the infrastructure (working all day in tools such as Kubernetes, Terraform, Jen‐ kins, and so on). In some other companies, MLEs are the ones who train ML models. As a personal example, my work experience has heavily involved ML model training, so I apply for jobs that have the title “machine learning engineer” or “data scientist.” I’ll provide more examples of skills and roles that could be a good fit for your inter‐ ests and skills in the following sections. As mentioned in the Preface , this book focuses more on the industry applications of ML rather than research roles. Here’s a brief overview of research roles: Requirements Most often PhD. Responsibilities Similar to academic roles/academia, such as conducting research and coming up with novel algorithms and improvements, authoring papers, presenting at aca‐ demic conferences, and so on. If you’re in a research role in industry , such as a researcher at Google DeepMind, the main difference is that there isn’t a require‐ ment for teaching (that I know of).',\n",

       "   'text': 'Now that you’ve gone through the entire ML interview process, it’s time to create a plan. In Chapters 1 and 2 , you learned about the many types of ML jobs and did a self-assessment of which one(s) might be more suitable for you. Based on that, you also learned about the skills you are expected to be stronger in. In the subsequent chapters, you learned about what types of questions are commonly asked in inter‐ views. Are there any types that you need to prepare more for? The goal of this book is for you to start bridging the gap, not just read about bridging the gap. To succeed in interviews and land the job, taking action will help you—not just thinking about taking action. Follow this checklist to create a plan for your interview process. Refer back to rele‐ vant content or past exercises in this book to help you complete the checklist: • Write down the parts of the ML lifecycle that you’re interested in doing at work. See Figure 1-5 in Chapter 1 for a reminder of the ML lifecycle. • Write down the skills that are required for that role and run the self-assessment of them in Chapter 2 . • Determine what types of interviews could be relevant for that role. Review the overview of the interview process in Chapter 1 . • Make sure your resume is tidied up, with bullet points relevant to the role you picked. Refer to Chapter 2 for more resume tips. • Write down a time frame during which you’re aiming to prepare for interviews and start applying. For example: I aim to prepare for interviews for three months and then start applying. Now that you have these components in place, it’s time to construct your roadmap.',\n",

       "   'text': 'As you saw in Figure 1-1 , there are additional interview types. Usually, they are more advanced components, assessing candidates on various combinations of ML, coding, training, and deployment (content that has been covered so far in Chapters 3 , 4 , and 5 and this chapter). Additional types that you might commonly hear about are: • Machine learning systems design interview • Technical deep-dive interview • Take-home exercises • Product sense I will briefly go through each of these interview types, so you are aware of how to prepare for them. I personally didn’t need to prepare for these types of interviews when I was looking for my entry-level role, as ML theory and coding were sufficient. However, I have encountered more and more advanced interviews as I progressed to senior and staff+ roles. Each company may ask for only some of these or none at all, so what you encounter in your interviews will differ. For example, Meta asks MLE candidates systems design questions, not just candidates at the “senior” level. ML systems design interviews and questions ask you to design something in an often hypothetical scenario. This could include asking you to design a brand-new system from scratch or how you’d hypothetically design a known system. Examples include: • “Imagine you are part of an ecommerce company’s ML team. It is aiming to use ML to increase customer retention. Walk through your initial approaches and how you would accomplish this.” • “How would you introduce ML-powered restaurant recommendations on Goo‐ gle Maps?” • “The online game our company is developing uses reinforcement learning to improve player experience. How would you design such a system?” ML systems design questions are often open ended, with plenty of back-and-forth with the interviewer asking follow-up questions that they find interesting. ML sys‐ tems design questions can be quite challenging for a couple of reasons: They likely don’t have a 100% correct answer. Since the questions are often about hypothetical scenarios, the questions them‐ selves might also change on the fly. For example, I (as the candidate) might ask the interviewer, “How many daily users are we expecting for this ML system?” Given the same question, by design the interviewer might not have defined all the parameters of the scenario and makes up a plausible number on the spot. Lots of what you do during the ML systems design is merely estimation and back-of-the-envelope math, and there is often no correct tool to choose (e.g., for some scenarios, you could use either XGBoost or CatBoost). ML systems design questions have high variance between each company, team, and interviewer. Much of your performance depends not only on your initial design but also on how you can respond to open-ended questions that could go in any direction. The interviewer could be curious about how you’d deal with the speed of the ML inference, and you could spend another five minutes on that topic. Or, by chance, they might ask instead about how you’d ensure that data quality is high before training the models. Treat it like improv and be able to adjust to how the conversation is flowing between you and your interviewer. Do yourself a favor and check the job posting to see what aspects you should focus on. Even in a scenario where the systems design questions ask you to design an end on. Even in a scenario where the systems design questions ask you to design an endto-end ML project, you can spend more time focusing on the core competencies of the position during the job interview. If you’re interviewing for a data scientist posi‐ tion that trains and evaluates ML models, then elaborate more on that and less on the deployment. Don’t ignore other aspects of the ML system if it’s an end-to-end system question, though. If you’re interviewing for an MLE position that focuses on deploy‐ ment, spend a little more time on that instead of getting stuck in a rabbit hole about data engineering. If in doubt, ask your interviewer if you’re focusing on the right thing and if they’d like to dive deeper on any topic. I won’t provide further examples here, since they would build on and combine the information from the ML algorithm, ML evaluation, ML deployment, and coding interviews that we’ve already discussed in this book. For entry-level roles, if there are systems design questions, they will focus on skills that have been covered in the pre‐ vious chapters. The most advanced systems design questions are mostly reserved for more senior and staff+ roles. For greater depth on this subject, I recommend the following resources: • “ML Systems Design Interview Guide” by Patrick Halina • Machine Learning System Design Interview by Ali Aminian and Alex Xu (ByteByteGo) • Search YouTube videos on example system design interviews for ML; this is a good example: “Harmful Content Removal: Machine Learning (System Design) Staff Level Mentorship” by Interviewing.io. (This question is aimed at the L7 staff position.) At Meta, example questions include “design a personalized news ranking system,” “design a product recommendation system,” and so on. As you can see from the fol‐ lowing breakdown, Meta is looking for an accumulation of the skills discussed in this book, not just a narrow subsection of them. The signals the interviewer is looking for from candidates include: Problem navigation Seeing if the candidate can organize the entire problem. Meta’s interview prep guide highlights that candidates should connect the problem to the business con‐ text. (Refer to Chapter 4 and the section “Product Sense” on page 214 .) Training data How would you collect training data and evaluate the risks? (Refer to Chapter 4 .) Feature engineering How would you come up with relevant features for the ML task? (Refer to Chapter 4 .) Modeling How do you justify choosing a specific model? Explain the training process, and explain the risks and how you’d mitigate them. (Refer to Chapters 3 and 4 .) Evaluation and deployment How do you evaluate and deploy the model? How do you justify which metrics to monitor? (Refer to Chapters 4 and 6 .) You can read Meta’s official resource in its software engineer ML full loop interview prep guide , which can be found on its careers site . In Meta’s interview prep guide, you’ll see repeated mentions of expecting candidates to come up with potential risks and mitigations for the ML designs they propose. This is a useful pattern of thinking for all ML interviews and a sign of a more effective and thoughtful ML practitioner. A useful and important way to improve your discus‐ sion of possible risks is to read about AI biases because they are a big part of risks. Research from Timnit Gebru and Joy Buolamwini are good resources; for example, they investigate ML algorithms’ accuracy disparities on gender and race (via skin type). 19 Meta’s own blog on progress and learnings in AI fairness and transparency also mentions various risks and mitigations. 20 Meta’s efforts include creating more datasets to “help researchers evaluate their computer vision and audio models for accuracy across a diverse set of ages, genders, skin tones, and ambient lighting conditions.” Technical deep-dive questions allow you to walk through something you’ve designed and built from scratch in the past, discussing the trade-offs and challenges you encountered along the way and how you addressed them. I have frequently seen this type of question grouped under behavioral questions that are related to past projects; for example, Shopify places a large emphasis on technical deep dives in its technical There are many companies that do this type of interview, and I’ve heard it called many names: case study interviews (different from the consulting type of case studies), reverse systems design, retro‐ spective systems design, and whatnot. I’m borrowing Shopify’s term, technical  deep dive , to refer to this kind of interview and interview questions in this book. Depending on the interview phase and the interviewer, answering this type of ques‐ tion can require more technical explanation and a deeper dive than the usual behav‐ ioral interview, and it has the depth and volleying that systems design has. However, it differs from the regular systems design questions with plenty of preparation mate‐ rial online since those questions focus on hypothetical situations instead of some‐ thing you actually built in a former job or project. Anecdotally, the more senior I get, the more questions I have gotten that are of the technical deep-dive variant. Here are important things to keep in mind while answering technical deep-dive questions: Justify and understand trade-offs in the system. Why did you choose BERT-cased over BERT-uncased? Why did you choose a basic Q-learning algorithm over a deep Q-network (DQN), or the other way around? Bring up analyses or benchmarks you ran during the time and be pre‐ pared to use them to justify your past choices. Deeply understand the main components you were responsible for. If you were responsible for training the model, be prepared to answer questions on the inner workings or even the mathematical foundations of those algorithms. For example, I’ve been asked how matrix factorization works, stemming from my project that used matrix factorization in the context of collaborative filtering. If you were responsible for the deployment infrastructure, such as in an MLE role, be prepared to answer more details on the Ops side. Sometimes, companies will provide an exercise or assessment for the candidate to do at home. These might be graded automatically, and a candidate would be passed or failed. There are also open-ended take-home exercises where the goal isn’t to pass or fail the candidate by the exercise alone but to combine it with an interview discussion where the candidate walks the interviewers through their solutions. The tips for ML algorithms and coding from previous chapters all apply: • Make sure you can not only explain the algorithms but also the trade-offs as well as why and how you decided on your approach. • Explain your thought process clearly to interviewers with docstrings in the code as well as verbally during the interviews. • Write tests! In data science and ML interviews, especially in big tech, a hidden requirement is that candidates possess some “product sense.” This is an umbrella term some companies use to describe whether a job candidate has practical knowledge on how ML benefits the company’s products. This can be shown when speaking about ML products and when you research the company’s products. It’s important to understand common product objectives for ML, such as: • Increase user convenience • Decrease user churn • Improve onboarding experience This is becoming more well-known nowadays; if you look up “data science product sense” on a search engine, some guides will show up. However, many candidates don’t think about preparing for this unless it’s explicitly mentioned by the recruiter or during the hiring process. As an ML candidate, you can integrate product sense into your behavioral interviews, systems design interviews, technical deep dives, and so on. The way you would prepare is to borrow from product manager interviews. From an interviewer’s perspective, I think of it this way. Does the candidate care only about model accuracy metrics, or do they also care about monthly average users of the product? Do they connect the ML they’re building to the product? Don’t underestimate this—when I was starting out in the ML field, much more expe‐ rienced people and successful peers recommended that I learn more about and understand the business side. This is one way that mentorship benefited my career: there is a lot of information that’s not shared in question-bank-type interview guides. In turn, I have included as much of that latent information as possible in this book. Here are some resources to get started: • “The Ultimate Guide to Cracking Product Case Interviews for Data Scientists” (Part 1) by Emma Ding • Exponent videos on product sense, such as this “Meta/Facebook Product Man‐ ager Mock Interview” • Cracking the PM Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell and Jackie Bavaro (CareerCup) Here are some interview questions I’ve used to interview MLOps engineers and MLEs who work on infrastructure. These interview questions include sample answers to help provide inspiration for your own potential responses. I want to point out that these questions mostly hinge on asking about your experience; most likely, the MLOps engineer and MLE will share the core coding interview loop ( Chapter 5 ) with other roles, and then the resume walk-through and technical deep-dive questions will include questions such as the ones I’ve given here. As I mentioned in Chapter 5 , those roles that are more focused on operations might also have more specialized coding questions that are similar to questions asked of DevOps engineers. At the risk of repeating myself too much, it is best that you double-check the job posting and with your recruiter and hiring manager, if possible, on the focus and expectations of the interview. For this chapter, it’s especially important to note that your answers will differ depending on your own experience; these answers are only high-level, relatively generic examples to show you what an answer might look like. Do not use them as a real answer in your interviews unless you’ve done the tasks/projects mentioned in the example answers. Example answer Using scaling on Kubernetes helped; for example, horizontal scaling helped dis‐ tribute the same workload across more instances. In cases when the heavy load came from request volume, I used load balancing with the Google Kubernetes Engine. In the past, I’ve used autoscaling features in cloud platforms, such as when I was working with GCP. Example answer For machine learning, I’ve learned that what’s different between monitoring an ML application in production as opposed to an application without ML is the data and model-related monitoring. This includes monitoring for data drift, model accuracy and drifts, and so on. For this, I use tools such as Great Expecta‐ tions or Alibi Detect . In particular, at my previous company we used Great Expectations to check for sudden large amounts of missing values or distribution shifts. In addition, using those monitoring tools, I can create alerts and have recurring anomaly-detection jobs on those platforms to report errors or drifts. On the ser‐ vice availability side (more general, less ML specific), tools such as Grafana, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana, aka Elastic Stack), and Prometheus are commonly used. Example answer I started by automating the steps involved in the ML pipeline, such as tidying up the scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Then I inte‐ grated those steps into a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins , triggering a pipeline run when there are changes to the code on our GitHub repo. This pipeline includes spinning up the environment, code linting, and testing, followed by automatic model deployment to a staging environment for further testing. Upon successful validation, the model is copied over to the production environment. These steps automated the deployment process, saving on manual deployment time and also allowing for quality control.In this chapter, I walked through the ML roles who might be interviewed on special‐ ized knowledge of their operations and infrastructure experience. Next, I discussed some levels and examples of end-to-end machine learning, which differ depending on the size and maturity of the data team. You also read about different types of cloud environments, trade-offs between private and public cloud, and common tools for ML model deployment and orchestration. I then discussed some model monitoring setups once the model has been deployed. I gave a brief overview of the popular cloud providers, noting that most cloud provid‐ ers have a similar toolkit, and if you use vendors that are not mentioned in this book, you’ll likely still find the equivalent services (just named something else). I brought up some developer best practices that are foundational for operations and software-heavy roles. Many of these things are naturally learned with work experi‐ ence, but for folks with school or bootcamp experience, you can still demonstrate these skills with group projects or open source contributions. Finally, I covered additional types of interviews for ML roles, such as systems design, technical deep dive, and product sense. In the next chapter, we’ll move onto behavio‐ ral interviews and how to succeed at them.',\n",

       "   'text': 'In Chapter 1 , you learned about the various steps you will go through as part of your ML interviews. In Chapter 2 , you looked at how to tie your experiences to roles of interest as well as how to craft a relevant resume. The goal of the previous chapters was to get you invited to interviews. In this chapter, I’ll focus on ML algorithms. As you recall, the interview process is illustrated in Figure 1-9 , and the ML algorithms interview is only one portion of the technical interviews; the rest, such as ML training and evaluation, coding, and so on, will be covered in subsequent chapters. You’re likely to be asked ML algorithm technical questions in an interview if you’re applying for any of the following jobs: • Data scientist who builds ML models • Machine learning engineer • Applied scientist • And similar roles Recall that within the common ML job titles ( Figure 1-8 ), there are some jobs that have the responsibility of training ML models in the ML lifecycle. This chapter focu‐ ses on assessing candidates for those skills; if the job you’re aiming for focuses less on training ML models, you might get a simplified version of this type of interview, or it might be skipped completely. This interview is meant to assess your understanding of ML algorithms, especially on the theoretical side. As to how you implement the algorithms with code, I cover that in the model deployment questions in Chapter 6 and the coding/programming tech‐ nical interview in Chapter 5 . The goal for you as an interviewee is for the interviewers to confirm that you understand the underlying concepts behind ML algorithms. Roles do exist where all you have to know is how to import the library with Python, but for more advanced projects, an underlying understanding can help you custom‐ ize various ML approaches and better debug and troubleshoot models. As covered in Chapter 1 , in the three pillars of ML roles, this is the pillar of ML algorithm and data intuition, which showcases your ability to adapt (refer to Figure 1-6 ). This skill is especially important in companies that have complex ML use cases and custom-made solutions, where you might modify or combine various off-the-shelf methods or cre‐ ate something from scratch. I try to mention as many common algorithms as space allows, but there are many more techniques under the sun. Be sure to check out the linked resources to extend your learning and interview preparation! It is also important to note that, in addition to understanding the ML algorithms’ inner workings and underlying statistical methods, you need to successfully commu‐ nicate that understanding to the interviewer. Yes, I know that communication skills have been brought up many times in this book, but they are what help set you apart as a successful candidate. As a rule of thumb, it’s important to be able to explain algorithms and ML concepts at two levels: on a simple “explain like I’m five years old” level and at a deeper, tech‐ nical level, one more appropriate for a college course. A second rule of thumb is to be prepared to answer follow-up questions to these ML algorithm interview questions. This is so the interviewer knows that you didn’t just memorize and then regurgitate the answer, but that you can apply it to various real-life scenarios on the job. In this chapter, I break down technical questions on the following topics so you can easily refer to a specific question if your interview focuses on that topic: • Statistical techniques • Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning • Natural language processing (NLP) • Recommender systems • Reinforcement learning • Computer vision In technical interviews that are very structured, such as the Ama‐ zon data science initial phone screen, they will ask you clearly scoped questions, such as asking for a definition of a particular algorithm. After you answer, they will generally move on without additional follow-up questions. There are companies that mix structured questions with a free-form discussion, where the inter‐ viewer might dig deeper into your answer, and the conversation might branch out from there into your past experiences.',\n",

       "   'text': 'In the first part of this chapter, I’ll walk through the structure of this book. Then, I’ll discuss the various job titles and roles that use ML skills in industry. 1 I’ll also clarify the responsibilities of various job titles, such as data scientist, machine learning engineer, and so on, as this is a common point of confusion for job seekers. These will be illustrated with an ML skills matrix and ML lifecycle that will be referenced throughout the book. The second part of this chapter walks through the interview process, from beginning to end. I’ve mentored candidates who appreciated this overview since online resources often focus on specific pieces of the interview but not how they all connect together and result in an offer. Especially for new graduates 2 and readers coming from different industries, this chapter helps get everyone on the same page as well as clarifies the process. The interconnecting pieces of interviews are complex, with many types of combina‐ tions depending on the ML role you’re aiming for. This overview will help set the stage, so you’ll know what to focus your time on. For example, some online resources focus on knowledge specific to “product data scientists,” but will title the course or article “data scientist interview tips” without differentiating. For a newcomer, it’s hard to tell if that is relevant to your own career interests. After this chapter, you’ll be able to tell what skills are required for each job title, and in Chapter 2 , you’ll be able to parse out that information yourself from job postings and make your resume as relevant to the job title and job posting as possible. This chapter focuses on helping you differentiate among various ML roles, and walks through the entire interview process, as illustrated in Figure 1-1 : • Job applications and resume ( Chapter 2 ) • Technical interviews — Machine learning (Chapters 3 , 4 , and 6 ) — Coding/programming ( Chapter 5 ) • Behavioral interviews ( Chapter 7 ) • Your interview roadmap ( Chapter 8 ) • Post-interview and follow-up ( Chapter 9 ) Figure 1-1. Overview of the chapters and how they tie into the ML interview process. Depending on where you are in your ML interview journey, I encourage you to focus on the chapters and sections that seem relevant to you. I’ve also planned the book to be referenced as you go along; for example, you might iterate on your resume multi‐ ple times and then flip back to Chapter 2 when needed. The same applies to the other chapters. With that overview, let’s continue. The companion site to this book, https://susanshu.substack.com , features bonus content, helper resources, and more.',\n",

       "   'text': 'In the previous chapters, I walked through the ML interview process and the ML algorithms and model training portions that are part of the technical interview. Tech‐ nical interviews can ask for much more of candidates beyond ML algorithms, stats knowledge, and model training, though. This chapter will cover one of those pieces, which is the coding interview. For jobs in machine learning, the kinds of coding that could be asked for will differ among companies and even among teams in the company. For example, when I was interviewing for data scientist and MLE roles, I got the following types of coding questions and tasks: • Company 1: Python questions related to data manipulation in pandas • Company 2: Python brainteaser questions (“LeetCode style”) only • Company 3: Data-related coding questions in SQL and Python Pandas • Company 4: Take-home coding exercise with a real-life scenario to code …and so on. There is a large variance in what companies might ask in a coding round of interviews. From what I’ve seen personally and heard from colleagues working as software engineers and hiring managers of software engineers, the ML coding inter‐ views are less standardized than the technical interviews for software engineering roles. On the bright side, interviewers for some ML roles don’t always ask candidates the most difficult “LeetCode style” questions, aka “LeetCode hards,” 1 since the candidate can be evaluated on their other skills, such as ML algorithm knowledge. This heavily depends on the role, though: for example, a candidate interviewing for an engineer title (such as MLE) at big tech gets the usual software engineering loop questions, which could include LeetCode hards. As usual, check with your recruiter. As I mentioned in “The Three Pillars of Machine Learning Roles” on page 12 , people working in ML are expected to clear both bars of programming and ML/stats. You aren’t expected to be the most skilled coder who is even more experienced than the average candidate for software engineer roles, but you need to be good enough to easily work with a team. You might encounter some teams where all you need is ML/stats knowledge, where you work with smaller scale data and never need to put things into production. Those companies may not test your coding skills during the interview process. But for this book, I tend to aim more toward ML roles where there is a blend of software engi‐ neering and ML since, without a way to distribute and serve the ML models, they don’t become part of the products that we use so much in our day to day. ML itself doesn’t make a Netflix recommender system, it’s putting that model into production and being a part of the frontend experience that customers interact with that brings in the user delight and thus revenue from ML. (For more on interviews that test your knowledge of model deployment, see Chapter 6 .) In this chapter, I’ll break down the common types of programming questions that show up in ML job interviews and walk through how to prepare: • A learning roadmap if you don’t know Python • Python questions related to data • Python brainteaser questions • SQL questions related to data Feel free to skip this section if you already know Python! The reasons I focus on knowing Python are: • Most, if not all, of the interviews for ML that I’ve been through assume you know Python to some extent. Most ML libraries you’ll be using at work have an imple‐ mentation in Python. • For interviewing, even software engineers recommend using Python in language • For interviewing, even software engineers recommend using Python in languageagnostic interviews over other languages because of the speed (of coding) and abstractions. Instead of spending valuable interview time coding out from scratch in C or C++, you could instead code just one or two lines in Python, which helps you focus on the important things in the interview. • Often in an ML job, you’ll be collaborating with other individuals and teams. Even if ML might be your main skill, the interviewers will be looking to see if you can write readable code that colleagues can read and use. Given these reasons, here’s a suggested roadmap to self-learn if you don’t know any Python or if you’re a little rusty. Find a book or course that focuses on practical code where you can immediately see the results. 2 Do the exercises in the book. Here are some resources I recommend: • Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart (No Starch Press): it’s free online, and the exercises are related to day-to-day activities. It starts with the bare basics of Python, such as using it for math ( 2+2 is the first line of code in the book), so anyone can get started with it. • For those who prefer video format, Al Sweigart has a playlist on YouTube that walks through his book in 15 video lessons. • Learn Python, Data Viz, pandas and More, tutorials at Kaggle . There are many similar online coding platforms, the most common (in North Amer‐ ica) being LeetCode and HackerRank . For simplicity, I will be using these two plat‐ forms the most as examples, but there might be other equivalents in your region or locale. Two classic beginner questions are Fizz Buzz and Two Sum . Try them on your plat‐ form of choice; it’s OK if you need to look at the answers during this early stage of learning. The goal is to understand the snippet of code—if you can understand this Even trying to complete one question a day or one question every two days is helpful for a beginner. Keep a tracker in your journal or phone. Try for an hour, and if you get stuck, look at the answers and read them or find video explanations until you understand . You can redo the question after a few more days to see if the understand‐ ing stuck. Avoid using rote memorization since the interview likely won’t have the exact same question, unless you’re supremely lucky. After you become familiar with some of the basics in Python, start with these tutori‐ als for using ML: • CatBoost: “Tutorial” • NumPy: “The Absolute Basics for Beginners” • pandas: “10 Minutes to pandas” The CatBoost tutorial can be a starting point for your first ML model! After this step, you can try using your own dataset or make modifications, try out other types of models, and build your own projects. Now, I’ll go through some tips for coding questions that may be asked during ML job interviews.',\n",

       "   'text': 'Statistical techniques are used in every data role, and these techniques are the foun‐ dations for ML projects. Hence, in ML interviews, you will most likely have questions that cover this topic. 1 Statistical techniques help build baseline models to compare more costly models and algorithms against or help discover if there is enough mean‐ ingful data in the first place to build ML models. For the purposes of this book, I will be placing the foundational regression tech‐ niques in this section, as well as various techniques for training and improving ML models. In short, these are (1) foundational techniques and (2) methods used during model training, such as training splits, regularization, and so on. These concepts are foundational knowledge for any type of ML algorithms that will be mentioned later as well as foundations for ML interview questions. This section covers the basics of statistical techniques for those who are unsure whether they have sufficient background knowledge in this area. Feel free to skip the subsections if you already have expertise in any of these areas. Regardless of your expertise, I’ve highlighted specific advice for ML interviews in the tip boxes to help you apply your knowledge of each ML area and excel in your interviews. To further supplement your knowledge on statistical and foundational techniques beyond the summaries I’ve provided in this book, I recommend the following resources: • The Elements of Statistical Learning by Trevor Hastie et al. • An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python by Gareth James et al. • Courses on Coursera by DeepLearning.AI and Andrew Ng; this resource is also useful for all following subtopics of ML (I won’t repeatedly link their courses— since they sometimes change and update—in the following sections). • Introduction to Machine Learning Interviews by Chip Huyen has additional questions for overall ML interviews which can be referenced for most sections in this chapter. Refer back to this section for reference material when preparing for interviews. Now, let’s jump in. Here’s an overview of one of the foundations of ML algorithms—variables—and a simple example of fitting a model. Let’s say that you have a dataset about apples, with the weight and height of each apple. You also have a list of past sales prices of each apple. With the list of apple weights, heights, and past sales prices, you want to guess the sales price of new apples, before they are sold. For the sake of this example, ignore big grocery chains automati‐ cally calculating a price, but let’s say you’re selling as a hobby to friends and family, or maybe you’re running a farm that a grandparent left you. So you are making use of the weight and height of each single new apple to predict its price. Weight and height are fixed observations at that point in time (an apple can’t be both 100 grams and 150 grams at the same time). Now, to connect all these concepts, let’s add in some terminology. Variables refer to everything that is being taken into account in your model of how apple prices are cal‐ culated. So the variables in this case include weight, height, and price. Within these variables, you know the weight and height of each new apple, and they are fixed at that point in time. So the weight and height are independent variables. Then, you have another variable, price, that you’d like to predict for new apples prior to know‐ ing the correct answer before selling them. The predicted price depends on the height and weight of the new apple. For example, heavier and taller apples sell for more money. Thus, price is a dependent variable (shown in Table 3-1 ). Table 3-1. Examples of independent and dependent variables The concepts of independent and dependent variables are tried and true, but the ter‐ minology might not be. In different fields, you may have come across the terms listed in Table 3-2 , although they may differ from industry to industry or from textbook to textbook. During your interview, make sure you and the interviewer aren’t crossing wires due to terminology, and double-check with your interviewer if you sense that you’re using a different term to refer to the same thing. Knowing the most common terms can help you use them appropriately in your interviews in various fields. Table 3-2. Synonyms of independent and dependent variables Models are a way of using past data points to describe “the way the world works,” or, in other words, a way of finding patterns and connections with past information. The apples example from the previous section uses a model that describes the way pricing works. The model is something that knows the “truth”—even if it’s not the full truth but rather our best attempt to approximate the truth. Thus, the model can be used to predict our best approximation of future data points. This applies for all “models” in ML models. Recommender-system models seek to predict what a user will like or click on when visiting a website. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition “learn” a model of what various pixels represent: is this cluster and layout of pixels a cat or a dog? Just as for independent and dependent variables, it is important to have a shared defi‐ nition for “model” to prevent miscommunication during an interview, such as con‐ fusing algorithms with models. 2 The model is the outcome of having run and fit an ML algorithm. I wanted to make sure I included regression models. I’m glad that I learned the detailed ins and outs of linear and logistic regression, even calculating them by hand (a requirement for the second-year statistics course I was taking as part of an eco‐ nomics major at university). This knowledge has compounded and helped me under‐ stand the new ML algorithms I’ve encountered as well as how to apply them in practice. All of my learning stemmed from understanding these entry-level concepts, so I highly recommend not shying away from learning the mathematics of regression models. Again, feel free to skip this section if you already have expertise in this area. Let’s use the apple example from an earlier section in a graph. For simplicity and to squeeze it onto a two-dimensional graph, let’s use just one independent variable, weight , to predict the dependent variable, price . Each dot on the graph in Figure 3-1 represents a data point from past sales, so you already know the sale prices for them. For example, the dot with a callout on the graph weighs 80 grams (its intersect on the x-axis) and sold for $1 (its intersect on the y-axis). Note that this is a simple example; most usage of linear regression will have multiple independent variables (“multivaria‐ ble”) and if visualized, will be a line in an N -dimensional space, where N = number of variables + 1 (when there is one output variable). In addition, this example has one dependent variable; when there are multiple dependent/output variables, the regres‐ sion task is referred to as being multivariate . Note that multivariate is separate from the “multivariable” concept mentioned earlier. Figure 3-1. Data points to be used for linear regression. The next step in linear regression is fitting the titular “line” to the data points. Behind the scenes, software tools like Python, Stata, IBM SPSS, SAS, MATLAB, and the like will calculate a “line of best fit.” According to the definition of a model given previ‐ ously in this section, this line is the model , which is the best approximation of the truth with the data points that you have. Starting with an initial line, the software will calculate the residual : the y-axis distance between a data point and the line, as illus‐ trated in Figure 3-2 . Colloquially, the residual is also referred to as the residual error . Figure 3-2. Fitting the line of best fit in linear regression; the line is iterated on until the residuals are as small as possible. All the residuals are squared so that predictions above and the line don’t cancel each other out due to having opposite signs (positive, negative). The goal is that the sum of the residuals is as small as possible since if you have a line that is drastically far away from the data points, that means the line isn’t fitting well to as many data points as possible and as correctly as possible. Mathematically, a common technique to tell how well the line is fitting is the process called least squares . Achieving least squares means finding the line that results in the smallest sum of squared residuals, which in turn means you have the “line of best fit”: the line is fitting the data points with least distance from the data points overall, as shown in Figure 3-3 . Figure 3-3. Least squares and terminology; y represents observed data points, and ŷ (y Figure 3-3. Least squares and terminology; y represents observed data points, and ŷ (yhat) represents the predicted/estimated values. The end result is a line that has the smallest sum of least squares to the data points, as illustrated in Figure 3-4 . Figure 3-4. The resulting line of best fit with least squares from the data in Figure 3-1 . Going forward, you can use this “line of best fit” as a model to predict new apple pri‐ ces! You can plug the apple weight into the line (in equation form) to get a numerical value for the predicted price. This is one of the most basic ways of calculating a model from data points, but it has the same pattern as more in-depth ML models and algo‐ rithms that are covered in the next chapter. Namely, you’ll initialize a line (you don’t know if this is the best model yet) and calculate the residuals, or how well it fits. Next, you’ll change the line by tilting it a little—mathematically, this is called updating coef‐ ficients or weights— and calculate the residuals again, as illustrated in Figure 3-2 . This updating process is called training , which is where the commonly used phrase “training/to train an ML model” comes from. If the sum of the squared residuals is getting smaller, then you are on the right track. When you can’t make the squared residuals any smaller, you’ve achieved least squares, and that’s how you can say the line is your best approximation with this dataset (as illustrated in Figure 3-4 ). It’s like that game where there’s an item hidden in the room, and as you walk around the room trying to find it, your friend says “hot” if you’re getting closer and “cold” when you’re walking farther away. You want to walk toward hotter and hotter areas in the room, until you reach the final position. In Chapter 4 , I’ll walk through ways to evaluate models via error terms such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and more, which are very sim‐ ilar concepts to residuals. The main difference here is that residuals are the difference between past observation data and model estimations while errors are the difference between model estimations and actual data previously unseen by the model. In other words, errors are the differences after applying the model to previously unseen data in order to evaluate model performance. To sum up, when using supervised 3 machine learning such as the simple linear regression example in the previous section, you’ll generally start with a dataset and want the ML algorithm to learn a model of how things work. You then will use the model to calculate the values of dependent variables, such as predicting how much apples will sell for before they are actually sold. In other words, you have a dataset of past data points and, of course, no future data points. When the ML model is being trained, it’s learning to “fit” the data that you currently have. There are some issues that could arise with model training when the model is used in the real world. For one, there will always be outliers or changing events in the real world. One example is in financial predictions with ML: the market could swing suddenly to a bear (downturn) market, and the model we’ve trained with financial data in a bull (upswing) market will produce horrible and wildly inaccurate predictions. Another example is that the dataset you have isn’t representative enough of the behaviors of the real world. In the apples example from the previous section, you assume that with the weight and height data of the apples, you can predict the sell price of new apples. But what if the data you have on hand isn’t enough, and apple variants like Fuji or Honeycrisp (one of my favorites) sell for more? You didn’t have each apple’s variant name tracked in your dataset, so then your model may be incorrect once you put it to the test. But for now, you have only the current dataset. To make the most of it, you need to keep some of the data you have for testing purposes. What this means is that you can break out 80% of the apple data points to use for model training and then save 20% of the apple data points to run the trained model predictions on. The 80% the model is trained on is called the training set (sometimes referred to as the train set ), and the 20% of data that is unseen by the model during the training phase is called the test set . This mimics the real-world scenario of running the model to predict new data points; the test set serves that purpose. In many cases, you might even split the data into three chunks: 80% as the training dataset, 10% as the validation (holdout) dataset, and another 10% as the test dataset ( Figure 3-5 ). The validation set allows you to monitor the model’s performance during the train‐ ing process without “formally” evaluating it, and it enables you to diagnose weak spots of the model and tune its parameters. The test set, as previously mentioned, was unseen by the model during the training process and thus is used to formally evaluate the model performance, mimicking a real-world environment as much as possible. Of course, having a test and validation set isn’t infallible, which brings us to more robust techniques and the concepts of model overfitting and underfitting. Figure 3-5. Training, validation, and test set splits. For interview questions on training and test sets, make sure you can name common ways to augment the simpler splits, such as using cross-validation : 4 splitting up data into smaller chunks and rotating through them as training sets. There are many reasons a model may not perform well on real-world data (or even the validation or test set). A common starting point is addressing overfitting or underfitting. Underfitting is when the model isn’t fitting well. This might mean that the model isn’t able to capture the relationship between the dataset’s independent variables (e.g., weight, height, etc.) and the dependent variables (e.g., price). Conse‐ quently, some ways to reduce underfitting are related to helping the model learn more nuances or patterns during the training process. For example, adding more variables, or model features, such as apple variant or age of the apple, could help the model learn more patterns from the training data and potentially reduce underfitting. A second way to reduce underfitting is to increase the Overfitting is when a model fits the training data too closely and very specifically, perhaps finding patterns that happen to be in the training set but not elsewhere. A simplified example is that the training data just so happens to have a lot of apples that are disproportionately expensive despite their weight (e.g., Sekai Ichi apples 6 ). The model learned from that data and overfit to it, therefore making incorrect predictions that are overpriced for cheaper apple variants. Simply put, the model is overmemo‐ rizing the training data and unable to generalize to new data points. There are many techniques to make the model generalize better, such as adding more training data, data augmentation, or regularization. 7 I’ll cover the details of regularization next. Regularization is a technique used to reduce overfitting of ML models. Generally, regularization will create a damper on model weights/coefficient. By this point, you likely know what I’m going to do—which is to bring up the apples again! Apples are my favorite fruit, which is probably why I use the example so often. So let’s say the model has learned to weigh “weight of apple” more heavily (accidental pun, but model “weights” is legitimate terminology); then the weight of the apple is mathe‐ matically increasing the results of the ML model’s prediction of the price by a rela‐ tively high positive value. If you can dampen the amount by which the weight of the apple increases the model’s predictions of the price, via regularization, that can make the model generalize more and take other variables into account more evenly. The variance bias trade-off is a common topic in ML interviews. When applying ML model improvement techniques such as regularization, it is important to consider the trade-off between fixing for bias versus variance. Bias refers to the overall inaccuracy of the model and can often be caused by an oversimplified (underfit) model. Variance comes from overfitting, when the model has learned too specifically from the training set. One way to remember why this is called “variance” is that the term refers to the variability of the model: the model is overfit to specific points or traits, so the model is very sensitive to different data points, causing fluctuation and variability. Regularization might cause a model to reduce its variance but might inadvertently increase bias, so that’s a reason to be cautious and test various model-improvement techniques. Now that I’ve covered various statistical and ML techniques at a higher level, let’s look at some sample questions. Here, I will dive into the details of common interview questions that stem from the concepts covered in this section. These details may not have been previously addressed, so my hope is that these sample questions also serve to explain the new concepts. Example answer L1 regularization , also known as lasso regularization , 8 is a type of regularization that shrinks model parameters toward zero. L2 regularization (also known as ridge regularization ) adds a penalty term to the objective function that is propor‐ tional to the square of the coefficients of the model. This penalty term shrinks the coefficients toward zero, but unlike L1 (lasso) regularization, it does not make any of the coefficients exactly equal to zero. L2 regularization can help reduce overfitting and improve the stability of the model by keeping coefficients from becoming too large. Both L1 and L2 regulari‐ zation are commonly used to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of ML models. Interview questions on model overfitting and underfitting may lead to follow-up questions. For example, if you bring up L1 and L2 regularization, the interviewer might ask, “What other types of reg‐ ularization could work?” In that case, you could bring up elastic net , which is a combination of L1 and L2 techniques. Or for the overfitting case, ensemble techniques can also help (refer to “Inter‐ view question 3-3: Explain boosting and bagging and what they can help with.” on page 76 ). Example answer Imbalanced datasets in ML refer to datasets in which some classes or categories outweigh others. 9 Techniques to deal with imbalanced datasets include data aug‐ mentation, oversampling, undersampling, ensemble methods, and so on: Data augmentation Data augmentation involves generating more examples for the ML model to train on, such as rotating images so that the dataset includes images of humans turned upside down as well as the normal upright image orienta‐ tion. Without data augmentation, the model might not be able to correctly recognize images of humans who are laying sideways or doing headstands since the data is imbalanced toward humans in an upright pose. Oversampling Oversampling is a technique to increase the number of data points of a minority class via synthetic generation. As an example, SMOTE (synthetic minority oversampling technique) 10 uses the feature vectors of the minority classes to generate synthetic data points that are located between real data points and their k-nearest neighbors. This could synthetically increase the size of the minority class(es) and improve the performance of the ML model trained on a dataset with oversampling treatment. Undersampling Undersampling does the opposite: it reduces examples from the majority class to balance the number of data points of the majority class and minority class(es). Oversampling is generally preferred in practice since undersam‐ pling may cause useful data to be discarded, which is exacerbated when the dataset is already small. Ensemble methods Ensemble methods can also be used to increase model performance when dealing with an imbalanced dataset. 11 Each model in the ensemble can be trained on a different subset of the data and can help learn the nuances of each class better. When answering ML interview questions, take a second to confirm the scope of the question. In other words, if the question is asking only for a definition of logistic regression, don’t go on a tangent about various other techniques. If the question is open-ended, you can confirm whether the interviewer is asking for something specific. Example answer Bagging and boosting are ensemble techniques used to improve the performance of ML models: Bagging Bagging trains multiple models on different subsets of the training data and combines their predictions to make a final prediction. Boosting Boosting trains a series of models where each model tries to correct the mis‐ takes made by the previous model. The final prediction is made by all the models. Ensemble techniques can help with a variety of issues encountered during ML training. For example, they can help with imbalanced data 12 and See Chapter 4 for more in-depth questions concerning model evaluation.',\n",

       "   'text': 'In ML roles, knowing when and what to pick from each family of techniques— including supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning—is an essential skill. In my previous jobs, I’ve used supervised learning to prevent fraud and customer churn, but at other times, I used unsupervised learning like anomaly detection for the same problem, depending on the data and situation. Sometimes (more often, as you grow more senior in your ML career), you might even create an ML pipeline with both supervised and unsupervised learning. In your reinforcement learning pipeline, you might use supervised learning in a previous step to label features. Understanding the underlying mechanics can help you adapt to new situations when using different techniques might be more effective than sticking to what is convenient. Therefore, in interviews there are often questions about supervised versus unsuper‐ vised learning. Reinforcement learning (RL) is considered a somewhat advanced topic and may not be touched on in many interviews. However, I’ve been asked about it in a nontrivial number of interviews because of the growth of RL use for industry applications such as in conjunction with recommender systems—although my past work experience in RL may have prompted the interviewers to ask me about it. As I mentioned in Chapter 2 , if something’s on your resume, it’s fair game to discuss in the interview! For a more comprehensive overview of RL, see “Reinforcement Learn‐ ing Algorithms” on page 101 . Regardless of what types of ML roles you’re interviewing for, knowledge about supervised and unsupervised learning is a must. Brush up on reinforcement learning concepts afterward, in terms of priority. This section covers the basics of labeled data, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi- and self-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning, those who are unsure whether they have the background knowledge in this area. Feel free to skip the subsections if you already have expertise in any of these areas. Regardless of your expertise, I’ve highlighted specific advice for ML interviews in the tip boxes to help you apply your knowledge of each ML area and excel in your interviews. To further supplement your knowledge on supervised and unsupervised ML tech‐ niques, beyond the summaries I’ve provided in this book, I recommend the following resource: • The Elements of Statistical Learning by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jer‐ ome Friedman Refer back to this section for reference material when preparing for interviews. Returning to our apple dataset from “Summarizing Independent and Dependent Variables,” you have the data points for how much apples sold for in the past. The price is also the dependent variable in “Summarizing Linear Regression.” The fact that you do have labels for the dataset 14 means that the ML tasks you were doing pre‐ viously were with labeled data. An example of unlabeled data is when you have the prices and weights of the apples but not the apple variants, yet you try to deduce commonalities within different variants of apples. Because you don’t initially have the correct or expected “label”—in this case, the apple variant—you would be using unla‐ beled data and conducting unsupervised learning. Building on the concept of labeled and unlabeled data, let’s move on to supervised learning. Supervised learning is the first type of machine learning as defined by its use of labeled data, illustrated in Figure 3-6 . Supervised learning uses correct or expected outcomes of the past to predict the dependent variables for new or future data points. The example of using apple weight, variant, and so on to predict sales prices for new apples is supervised learning. Supervised learning can be broken down into two main categories: regression and classification. Figure 3-6. Overview of machine learning families (simplified for understanding). In regression tasks, the dependent/output variable is a continuous value. For example, predicting stock prices, housing prices, or weather (temperature) produces continu‐ ous values. Classification is a type of supervised learning in which the dependent/ output variable is categorical—that is, it is put into a category, such as “it’s a dog” or “it’s a cat.” Classification examples include detecting whether something is or isn’t spam, using image recognition such as tagging animal types in a picture, and so on. It is possible to mix categorical data with continuous data via techniques such asone onehot encoding . For example, if we’re trying to classify if there is a dog or a cat in an image, an image that has a dog will be encoded with 1 for the “dog” category and 0 for the “cat” category. Think of it like a Boolean (True/False) representation of the data for each category. Then you can mix these numerical encodings (0 or 1) with datasets with continuous values. Unsupervised learning is training a model with unlabeled data: when you do not have the “labels” available (the labels being the correct or expected values that you are looking for). You’d likely use unsupervised learning to find patterns, commonalities, or anomalies in the dataset without prior knowledge in the ML model of correct or expected result labels. Common usage of unsupervised learning includes clustering and dimensionality reduction (see Figure 3-6 ). Many generative models are unsupervised, such as varia‐ tional autoencoder (VAE), which is used with applications like Stable Diffusion for image generation. Clustering is an ML task that groups similar data points together into clusters, as illustrated in Figure 3-7 , which allows you to see any emerging patterns. While you won’t be able to deduce any labels that you don’t have, you can still find outliers or clusters of interest to further investigate. Unsupervised learning can be used for cus‐ tomer segmentation because you can hypothesize that customers in the same clusters might have similar preferences or behaviors. You can use unsupervised learning for anomaly and outlier detection since you can find abnormal patterns in the data without prior knowledge of what an “anomaly” looks like. Figure 3-7. Example of unsupervised learning: clustering. Dimensionality reduction is a common technique used to reduce the number of redundant input variables in training data. Reducing the number of features/input variables can help to reduce overfitting since models that learn from too many vari‐ ables might also learn from the “noise” from those variables. Additional variations as extensions of supervised and unsupervised learning have become more popular in the industry, especially because of limitations on fully label‐ ing large amounts of data. You might not encounter these concepts much during interviews, but you should be aware of them. If the team you’re interviewing with uses these techniques, it will be good to be prepared to discuss them. Semisupervised learning uses a small amount of labeled data (usually manually labeled) to train a separate ML model specifically meant to help with machine label‐ ing previously unlabeled data. The initial labeled dataset is then combined with the machine-generated labels with highest confidence to create a larger labeled dataset, as illustrated in Figure 3-8 . Figure 3-8. Semisupervised learning overview. Self-supervised learning 15 relies on the dataset itself to learn latent representations, without labels. For example, in an image, if certain parts are removed, can we predict or generate those missing parts? Common usage of self-supervised learning includes filling in missing parts of images, audio, video, 16 text, and so on. Semisupervised and self-supervised learning can be brought up in interview answers to help with a lack of labeled data or cases where it’s not necessary to label all the data. The third major type of machine learning based on the dataset or the usage of labels is reinforcement learning (RL). In it’s simplest form, RL doesn’t necessarily require a prior dataset, although generally in industry, I’d still prefer to have some existing dataset or existing model so I can test the RL algorithms offline (not live) before deploying the RL agent into the real world or into the hands of customers. RL relies on an “agent,” which is not the same as the concept of an ML “model” that I introduced earlier, although they do have similarities in that they both improve and learn through iterations. RL learns through trial and error. The agent only needs to react to each new data point as it comes in, and the agent eventually learns enough from experience to figure out an optimal way of predicting the best action to carry out next. A common RL example is a robot learning to navigate a maze that has rewards, traps, and an exit (for an example, see Figure 3-14 later in this chapter). The first time the robot moves through the maze, it has no knowledge of where the gold, traps, and exit are. But as it encounters those things in the environment, it also acquires knowledge, or data points, about the past, similar to constructing its own dataset via trial and error. After the robot has navigated the maze enough times, it learns the fastest and safest path to the exit. But based on how you design the RL agent, it can also optimize for various goals, such as collecting the most gold instead of reaching the exit as fast as possible. There are various types of RL, some of which resemble supervised learning, but I will leave the in-depth discussion of those for the section “Reinforcement Learning Algo‐ rithms” on page 101 . RL is commonly used in gaming, robotics, and self-driving cars, but RL can also be used for a growing number of applications that previously used supervised learning, such as a system that recommends videos on YouTube. Now that I’ve covered supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning at a higher level, let’s look at some common interview questions that stem from these concepts. This section specifically covers interview questions on supervised and unsupervised learning; since RL has its own section, “Rein‐ forcement Learning Algorithms” on page 101 , the questions on RL can be found there. Example answer The regression family of algorithms includes linear regression and logistic regres‐ sion, among other algorithms such as generalized linear models (GLMs) and var‐ ious time-series regression models such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). The decision tree family of algorithms can be used for both classification and regression tasks within supervised learning; these include XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and so on. Decision trees can be combined in random forest algo‐ rithms, which ensemble (combine) a multitude of decision trees. Like decision trees, random forests can be used for both classification and regression tasks under supervised learning. Neural networks can be used for supervised learning tasks as well as unsupervised learning. In terms of supervised learning, these include many tasks in this sec‐ tion, such as image classification, object detection, speech recognition, and natu‐ ral language processing (NLP). Other algorithms include naive Bayes, 17 which is a supervised classification algorithm that uses Bayes’ theorem . 18 Applications of Bayes’ theorem in ML include Bayesian neural networks, 19 which predict a distribution of results (for example, a normal model might predict the price is $100, but the Bayesian model will predict the price is $100 with a standard deviation of 5). Example answer Unsupervised learning is commonly used for clustering, anomaly detection, and dimensionality reduction. I’ll group the algorithms by those categories. Cluster‐ ing is often done with algorithms such as k-means clustering and density-based clustering (DBSCAN algorithm). K-means clustering groups the data into k clusters, and the algorithm iteratively labels each data point with the cluster’s centroid. The cluster centroid is then updated, and the algorithm continues until the cluster assignments have reached a stable state and no longer shift or change. DBSCAN is a popular algorithm that groups together data points that are close to one another (high density) and also separates those clusters from one another depending on their distance. Because unsupervised learning algorithms can han‐ dle large class imbalances, there are common unsupervised learning algorithms that address anomaly detections. There are many algorithms that can be used for dimensionality reduction. Princi‐ pal component analysis (PCA) can “flatten” datasets into a lower-dimensional space. This is useful for data preprocessing since it can reduce the number of redundant features that are used while keeping the variance in the data so that enough signals and patterns are preserved in the data. Autoencoders are a type of unsupervised learning with a broad range of applica‐ tions, notably in NLP—but not limited to NLP. They can be used to encode a compressed representation of input text, which is also a form of dimensionality reduction, and then decode the compressed representation for the generation of the next chunk of text data. This is useful for text completion and text summari‐ zation tasks. As a subset of unsupervised learning, self-supervised learning is also a case where autoencoders can be used. Examples include self-supervised learn‐ Example answer The major difference between the two types of machine learning is related to the training data that is used. Supervised learning uses labeled data while unsuper‐ vised learning uses unlabeled data. Labeled data refers to the correct output or result from the ML model already being inside the training dataset. Supervised and unsupervised learning also differ in terms of the ML model out‐ puts. In supervised learning, the ML model aims to predict what the label would be. Unsupervised learning doesn’t predict specific label(s) but rather tries to find latent patterns and groupings within the dataset, which can be used to cluster new data points. In terms of evaluation, the two types of ML are assessed differently. Supervised learning is evaluated by comparing its outputs with the correct output (with the test/holdout/validation datasets). In unsupervised learning, the model is evalu‐ ated based on how well it groups or captures patterns within the data, via metrics such as the Jaccard score or silhouette index for clustering and receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC)/area under the curve (AUC) metrics for positive rate Finally, supervised learning and unsupervised learning are generally used for different types of tasks. Supervised learning is often used for classification (pre‐ dicting the correct category) or regression (predicting the correct value) tasks while unsupervised learning is often used for clustering, anomaly detection, and dimensionality reduction tasks. Example answer Unsupervised learning and supervised learning differ in the usage of results or labels. Hence, unsupervised learning is most suitable for cases where labeled data is not available or when the task isn’t to predict a “correct” output, but rather to find patterns or anomalies in the data. As a real-world example, supervised learning can be used for classification and object detection, such as in image recognition tasks. In the training dataset I’ll have the correct objects labeled, and the algorithms will then know if they’re learning to detect objects correctly based on comparing their predictions with the ground truth. In other words, if the algorithm isn’t correctly boxing faces in images, I’d know since I’ll have each image (with the faces correctly boxed) to compare to. Other scenarios for supervised learning could include predicting the price of a rare trading card based on its features, such as its age, its series name, and the condition of the card. Given that I have a dataset with fraudulent data already correctly labeled, fraud detection could also be an application of super‐ vised learning. If I didn’t already have labeled data about fraudulent behavior, I might opt to use unsupervised learning instead, via detecting anomalous behaviors. In a real interview, you might not have to come up with so many examples, but as a reference answer, I’m including a few. It’s even better if you can come up with an example that’s a common con‐ cern for the industry of the company where you’re interviewing. For example, time-series examples are often relevant to finance and fintech industries, and fraud detection is relevant to online sales platforms, banking, and finance. Sometimes unsupervised learning is more suitable than supervised learning. For gen‐ eral warning signs of abnormal behavior, anomaly detection can be used to find an anomalous login location for a user’s online bank account. Clustering is an unsuper‐ vised learning task, and a real-world application could be to group customers into segments based on their features (e.g., behavior, preferences), something that busi‐ nesses might use to identify how they can tailor products to users in a cluster or to target marketing campaigns. If I investigate a cluster and it shows that young professionals have similar behaviors via the clustering algorithm, then we might know that we can give them similar promotional materials in the company’s next dig‐ ital ad campaign. Example answer One common problem that can affect supervised learning is the lack of labeled data. For example, when I want to classify specific cartoon and anime characters in images with ML, I don’t have labeled data available on the internet to down‐ load and use. There are open source datasets such as CIFAR, 22 which are labeled for general objects and items, but when it comes to more specific use cases, I would have to acquire and label images myself (for personal usage). I had to address the issue of not having enough labeled data; in this case, hand labeling a few examples worked as a starting point. However, there still weren’t enough labeled examples, which resulted in an imbalanced dataset. To artificially increase the amount of labeled data, I used data augmentation, creating synthetic data and variations on existing data to make the ML model more robust. An example of data augmentation in image recognition is to randomly flip or rotate images. To illustrate why this can increase samples, if I flip one upright anime character looking to the right, it becomes two data points for the model to learn from: one looking right and one looking left. Rotation can also help: can the ML algorithm correctly identify anime characters who are leaning sideways or who are even upside down, doing a headstand? Another tip is to tie techniques that you’ve used to your past experience (so you can answer the interviewer’s follow-up questions more easily) or to scenarios that you know would be relevant to the employer’s industry, as mentioned before.',\n",

       "   'text': 'NLP has gained traction in recent years, with the notable example of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. There are a lot of interview questions that build off the foundational tech‐ niques of transformers, and subsequently the BERT and GPT families of models, so I will cover those concepts in this section. NLP is often applied in chatbots and sentiment analysis (for example, to see if the general attitude toward a product or company is positive or negative, based on Reddit or Twitter posts) as well as to generate written content. If you are interviewing for a company or team that is working on NLP, you will definitely be asked to demon‐ strate your understanding of these concepts in depth. Even if you’re not interviewing for an NLP team specifically, I’d still recommend having a general understanding of NLP applications, which will make you a more well-rounded candidate and ML pro‐ fessional. Not to mention, NLP techniques are no longer used to generate written content only; they are also being combined with computer vision, text-to-image models to generate images, video, audio, and so on. Even time-series prediction and recommender systems have started picking up NLP techniques. You’ll benefit from learning the basics of NLP because of how generalizable the techniques are. This section covers the basics of NLP techniques for those who are unsure whether they have the background knowledge in this area. Feel free to skip the subsections if you already have expertise in any of these areas. Regardless of your expertise, I’ve highlighted specific advice for ML interviews in the tip boxes to help you apply your knowledge of each ML area and excel in your interviews. To further supplement your knowledge of NLP techniques beyond the summaries I’ve provided in this book, I recommend the following resources: • Generative Deep Learning by David Foster (O’Reilly) • Natural Language Processing with Transformers by Lewis Tunstall, Leandro von Werra, and Thomas Wolf (O’Reilly) • The Practical Guides for Large Language Models on GitHub • Practical Natural Language Processing by Sowmya Vajjala, Bodhisattwa Majumder, Anuj Gupta, and Harshit Surana (O’Reilly) Refer back to this section for reference material when preparing for interviews. Let’s break down the components that power NLP. First, you have a dataset, often called a text corpus . 23 A text corpus can consist of many types of text, such as news, online forums, or anything with a lot of authentic and meaningful text that isn’t gibberish. Next, with this dataset you’ll need to preprocess the data much like you would for other ML jobs. Some common techniques that are quizzed about in inter‐ views are tokenization, bag of words, or TF-IDF (term frequency–inverse document frequency). Tokenization is the process of breaking down the text into individual words, phrases, or useful semantic units. 24 For example, depending on the situation, the word “pre‐ process” could be left as its own token or separated into “pre” and “process.” “Aren’t” could be left as its own token but could also be separated into “are,” and “n’t.” Once the dataset has been preprocessed, language modeling can be formulated to predict the next sequence of items, which could be the next word (as illustrated in Figure 3-9 ), the next sentence, the next paragraph, missing words, and so on. Figure 3-9. Next word or phrase prediction, as seen in autocomplete on phones or Bag of words ( BoW ) is a way to map a sentence or phrase by mapping the words in it to a vector. The vector can consist of the words and other info, such as how many times the word has appeared (1 if once, 2 if twice, and so on). An example .json representation for the sentence “Syd likes to drink bubble tea and chamomile tea” would be: Note that the word “tea” appears twice, and thus the count is 2. TF-IDF uses the frequency of the appearance of words in a passage or document to determine how relevant those words are. Although it shares many foundational concepts with other types of ML, NLP comes with unique challenges. In cases where supervised learning is used, such as down‐ stream fine-tuning, the data is hard to label. For example, if you are using supervised fine-tuning for sentiment analysis to quickly predict if a user review is positive or negative, it can be ambiguous at times. Another challenge is that there’s a large amount of variability, such as slang and regional syntax differences, which can also lead to data sparsity, where exact combinations of words might rarely appear in the text corpus but are still valid. Common use cases of NLP include sentiment analysis, chatbots, text classification (e.g., spam versus not spam), text generation, text summarization, text-to-image gen‐ eration, and many more. BoW and TF-IDF are useful underlying techniques that I’ve recently heard mentioned in interviews. Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network designed to handle long sequences of data, which is useful in NLP applications. Like attention units in transformers, long-term dependencies and context of prior text are important for NLP to be effective. However, LSTMs have some limitations, such as when dealing with very long sequences of text—that is, understanding the context of text that came much earlier in a page or paragraph. To that end, transformers (cov‐ ered in the next section) are able to handle long-term dependencies better. LSTMs can be used for feature engineering and time series as well. I don’t include more explanation here because of space constraints, but I encourage you to read more. Christopher Olah’s blog Under‐ standing LSTM Networks offers a good series of illustrations for understanding how LSTMs are used. The transformer model was introduced by Google in 2017, 26 which has enabled a larger scope of language models in recent years. Transformers are effective at NLP modeling because of their improvements in handling context and meaning over longer text strings compared to existing architectures like convolutional neural net‐ works (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). 27 Transformers are also better suited to finding patterns within the dataset, as opposed to requiring large, labeled datasets like CNNs and RNNs do. Hence, there is a lower barrier to entry for what datasets are available. With transformers, large, free-form text corpora from the internet became available for use, without the need for costly labeling beforehand. Attention units within the transformer network are part of transformers’ effective‐ ness and can find both short- and long-distance relationships between words, which helps the model correctly label the context. Take, for example, the sentences “Max went to the record store. Later, he bought a Jay Chou album.” Self-attention units can correctly identify that “ he ” is referring to “Max.” Combined with BERT’s encoder architecture and multihead attention mechanisms, this has resulted in significant improvements in the performance and capabilities of NLP tasks. Developed by Google, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Trans‐ formers) models have been used to process queries on the Google search engine since 2019. 28 As hinted at in its full name, BERT makes use of the transformer neutral net‐ work discussed earlier. BERT is pretrained, meaning the initial training step done by Google generates the model that users can access 29 via “self-supervised” learning on a large corpus of text, such as Wikipedia and other text datasets. There are two tasks BERT is trained on during pretraining: masked language modeling (MLM) and next sentence prediction (NSP). Masked language modeling refers to randomly “masking,” or blocking/removing, sev‐ eral tokens in a sentence and letting the model learn to correctly predict those tokens—for example, “Lisa is singing a [MASK],” where [MASK] signifies the token for BERT to predict. This is illustrated in Figure 3-10 . If BERT can predict that “song” or “melody” or other words have a higher probability of being correct, then the model training is going well. If it’s predicting words or tokens like “dog,” then it is not being accurate at that point during model training. Figure 3-10. Illustration of masked language modeling. Next sentence prediction is the second task that BERT is trained on. The goal is to accurately predict the next sentence in a text sequence. Since this training process can provide feedback to the model without external labeling, it is not “supervised” learning per se, but it is described as “self-supervised” since the feedback comes from the text corpus itself. After model pretraining, users can then download the model or use an API 30 to “fine-tune” the model to their own use cases. This improves on the user’s copy of the BERT model and requires supervised learning. For example, the user may wish to use BERT for sentiment analysis; in that case, the user would need to provide examples and labels of text that have a positive sentiment, negative sentiment, or ambiguous sentiment (if the user wishes). If you want to use BERT to generate text with a spe‐ cific tone—for example, a movie supervillain—you’d need to provide BERT-specific examples as part of fine-tuning. BERT saves the user a lot of time on tasks like these since it already has a general understanding of the target language (English, among pretrained models of other languages that have been created by various developers 31 ). Fine-tuning can be used for many other ML models, not just BERT. For example, you can fine-tune models such as GPT-3.5 (at the time of writing). However, I include fine-tuning under BERT since I have seen many interviews ask about fine-tuning in the con‐ text of BERT. The GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) family of NLP models is known for powering the OpenAI tool, ChatGPT. The GPT family of models includes GPT-1, GPT-2, GPT-3, and GPT-4 at the time of writing. 32 They are trained on large corpora of text, 33 such as BookCorpus, WebText (Reddit), English Wikipedia, and more. The GPT family leverages transformers and is pretrained on predicting the next word. Like other major NLP models, it can be fine-tuned 34 downstream to update the pretrained model’s parameters to parameters targeted toward more specific tasks, such as text generation. Notably, GPT-3 (with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 powering ChatGPT at the time of writing) also uses RL via user feedback to improve its model predictions. RL is covered in more detail in “Reinforcement Learning Algorithms” on page 101 . Apart from GPT, several other large language models (LLMs), such as PaLM2 (which powers Google Bard), Llama/ Llama 2 (Meta AI), and more 35 are trained on similar techniques. NLP has been growing at a fast pace, with many well-known LLMs being released in recent years (as illustrated in Figure 3-11 ). I encourage candidates interested in the field to learn more about these models and techniques. I remember exploring Word2vec 36 and GloVe 37 at work, and now there are so many other ways to develop NLP applications. Many foundational methods such as those two and models like BERT are still commonly used, and hiring managers I know still ask about them, so don’t neglect the foundations either! Figure 3-11. Evolutionary tree illustration of large language models; used with permis‐ sion from “The Practical Guides for Large Language Models” . Now that I’ve covered some foundational techniques used in NLP, it’s time to look at some interview questions. The NLP space and applications in generative AI have been moving very quickly, so we’ll see how things change! However, from speaking to hiring managers in my network, I know that all of them still expect knowledge on foundational topics and data preprocessing techniques for NLP use cases. Example answer BERT and other NLP models that have been pretrained can be fine-tuned. A large source of pretrained NLP models is the Hugging Face model repository. Pretrained models may include user-uploaded fine-tuned models of original models by Google, OpenAI, and so on, but users can also download models fine models by Google, OpenAI, and so on, but users can also download models finetuned on tasks like sentiment analysis. If I wanted to fine-tune one of the original models myself, I’d need to provide a labeled dataset for the NLP model. For example, for sentiment analysis, that would include examples of both positive and negative sentiment text; for chat‐ bots, I might provide labeled data with the correct corresponding answer to a help desk question; and for named entity recognition, I’d provide examples of the named entities that I’d expect the NLP model to correctly output. Example answer When starting from a raw corpus, a quick first step is to use regex (regular expression) techniques to clean up unwanted characters. Some downstream tasks don’t rely much on punctuation, but tasks like sentiment analysis could benefit from keeping punctuation; we can see how “!” could be useful for sentiment analysis. Next, we can use tokenization to break the text down into meaningful units, which often happen to be words; for example, “Susan is writing a sentence” becomes the five tokens: “Susan, is, writing, a, sentence.” Stemming and lemmatization both aim to reduce a word to its base form so that tense variations and derivations can still point to the same root word. Stemming is a rough heuristic that removes the ends of words (such as cars → car; history → histori and historical → histori). 38 Stemming is a cruder technique than lem‐ matization , which makes use of the dictionary forms of a base word; for example, in lemmatization, “studying,” “studies,” and “study” will all be lemmatized as “study.” This is useful for the NLP model to recognize that these words mean the same at their root. Example answer Possible challenges with NLP, even with robust pretrained models, could be homonyms/synonyms, sarcasm, or domain-specific language such as that of financial or legal documents and the like. All of these can be improved upon with better downstream fine-tuning with more data that targets the specific case. For example, you can provide more examples of the usage of synonyms so that the NLP model can pick out more signals on when to use which word. There are also inherent biases in many cases; pretraining corpora that are com‐ monly used for LLM training, such as Wikipedia, have a disproportionate number of male volunteer editors. Reddit, being a forum with a large text dataset, is also commonly used as a base for a training dataset and has a disproportionate number of male users. Laura Weidinger et. al (Google DeepMind and collaborators) have published a paper on ethical and social risks of harm from language models that discusses perpetuation It’s important to read through considerations like these; especially in interviews cov‐ ering language models or data acquisition (see Meta’s system design interview in Chapter 6 ), candidates being knowledgeable and thoughtful about potential risks (including biases) is important to succeeding at interviews. Example answer BERT-uncased has a tokenizer that will lowercase text input, so regardless of passing in cased (including uppercase) or all lowercase (uncased) text, it will be the same for BERT-uncased. BERT-cased , however, has a separate entry for the same words with different cases; for example, “The” will be different from “the” in BERT-cased. Thus, BERT-cased has the ability to distinguish between differ‐ ent semantics based on case. In applications where the case information doesn’t matter much, then BERT-uncased may be suitable. However, for situations where cased information is important, such as where proper nouns are valuable for the NLP task, BERT-cased will be preferred. You can see a trend in these questions: regardless of the NLP appli‐ cation (even if it’s generative AI!) knowing how to adapt to situa‐ tions is essential. Preprocessing will be different if proper nouns are useful (don’t lowercase everything), and while sometimes you might keep the punctuation (such as in sentiment analysis), some‐ times you don’t. Deeply understanding NLP techniques can help you respond much better in interviews than if you only memorize and regurgitate.',\n",

       "   'text': 'Recommender systems (RecSys) are everywhere in our digital lives and are responsible for personalization of the web pages and apps you visit, such as Netflix, YouTube, Spotify, any social media site, and much more. One way to tell if a site has personali‐ zation is by comparing the order of items or products shown on its front page or search results when two different people are logged in. For example, what is shown on your YouTube front page is likely not the same as the front page of a sibling or friend. A recommender system recommends items or products that it thinks you might enjoy, interact with, or purchase based on your past behavior. For example, Netflix uses information on what shows and movies you’ve watched before as signals in its recommender systems to suggest new shows and movies for you. Since so many tech products use recommender systems, this is a common “default” category that interviewers at big tech companies will ask about. This section covers the basics of recommender systems techniques for those who are unsure whether they have the background knowledge in this area. Feel free to skip the subsections if you already have expertise in any of these areas. Regardless of your expertise, I’ve highlighted specific advice for ML interviews in the tip boxes to help you apply your knowledge of each ML area and excel in your interviews. To further supplement your knowledge on recommender techniques beyond the summaries I’ve provided in this book, I recommend the following resources: • Practical Recommender Systems by Kim Falk (Manning) • Use cases and papers via Eugene Yan’s curated applied ML repository Refer back to this section for reference material when preparing for interviews. Collaborative filtering is a common technique in recommender systems. The term comes from using data on preferences of many users and/or items (collaborative) to make recommendations for a singular user (filtering). This is based on an assumption that individuals with similar past preferences can share preferences for new, unseen products; hence, the algorithm will recommend new items liked by simi‐ lar users. There are two main types of collaborative filtering techniques: user based and item based. User-based collaborative filtering identifies users with similar interests and preferences and then recommends products or items to each of those similar users that they haven’t seen before. “Similar” users are calculated by ML algorithms, such as matrix factorization, which will be covered later in this chapter. Item-based collab‐ orative filtering identifies items that are similar to one another based on their user ratings or user interaction. Items are then recommended by the collaborative filtering algorithm if a user has previously enjoyed similar items. In user-based and item-based collaborative filtering, you generally need to know users’ ratings and preferences. If a user has left a good rating and review, then you can explicitly know that they enjoy a product. But users simply don’t have enough time to provide explicit, detailed feedback on everything—think about the times you’ve left a review; you likely didn’t do so for every single item you’ve used in the past. However, you can still calculate implicit feedback, such as the time spent on a YouTube video: if someone watches to the end, it could mean the viewer liked it more than a video they closed after two seconds. Using implicit feedback within a recommender system can help alleviate some common biases as well; people are more likely to leave an explicit review if they either loved or hated the product (and you know people are more vocal if something went wrong). In Chapter 4 , I’ll discuss model training and data preprocessing. For recommender systems applications, making sense of the avail‐ able explicit and implicit ratings during exploratory data analysis, model training, data preprocessing, featuring engineering, evalua‐ tion, and monitoring is important to discuss in interviews. Another common type of recommender system is the content-based system. In a content-based recommender system, you need detailed information about the prod‐ ucts themselves. This information could include traits of text descriptions (book blurbs, movie genres and descriptions), images (product screenshots), audio/video (trailers, product videos), and so on to create an understanding of which items are similar to one another. In contrast, the user- and item-based collaborative filtering described earlier relies on user preferences of items or products but not the traits of the items themselves. An example content-based movie recommender system could recommend movies based on the genre, director, or actors of movies that the user has previously watched and enjoyed, as measured by explicit and implicit feedback. Hence, a content-based recommender systems can be formulated as a ranking or classification problem, and algorithms like tree-based models are suitable. There are some pros and cons to using user-based/item-based or content-based rec‐ ommender systems. User-based systems don’t perform as well with new users; this is commonly referred to as the “cold-start” problem since there isn’t enough data on the users’ preferences because they may not have bought or rated any products yet. Content-based recommender systems might need less user-behavior data since they do not rely on other users’ preferences or ratings, which makes them suitable for newer users or niche items with less user feedback overall. But content-based systems might be limited to recommending items similar to what the user has interacted with before; therefore, new items are not introduced to the user, limiting the diversity of the products or items that the user might have enjoyed had they been recommended those products. Knowing the trade-offs between user-based, item-based, and content-based recommender systems can help you in interviews as well as on the job. In reality, explicit feedback can be hard to come by, and implicit feedback might not be perfect. Knowing how to mix and match all the data and RecSys algorithms at your disposal will help you stand out by a lot. Matrix factorization is a technique used in collaborative filtering. First, a matrix is constructed with users as the rows and items as the columns, with the ratings or pref‐ erences of a user on an item as the cell values. This is called the user-item matrix , as illustrated in Figure 3-12 . Since not all users interact with all items, the original matrix will be very sparse. For example, a user might have interacted with only a handful of items, but the online platform has thousands or millions of products. The goal of matrix factorization is to predict those empty values in the matrix—that is, how much a user would rate the items they haven’t interacted with before—and recommend those that you estimate that the user would enjoy. Figure 3-12. Illustration of matrix factorization; source: Google . A classic algorithm is singular value decomposition (SVD); however, I have never seen it used outside of practice datasets because of its expensive computational requirements. 40 For industry applications, if as an ML practitioner you choose to use matrix factorization, the chosen algorithm needs to be able to handle very sparse and large matrices since many online platforms have a large number of products and users. Algorithms such as ALS help address this issue since they use approximation via least squares (covered in “Summarizing Linear Regression” on page 68 ) to calcu‐ late their best guesses for the missing matrix values (how much a user might enjoy an item) instead of the complex matrix manipulations that traditional SVD uses. Now that I’ve covered the basics of recommender systems, let’s go through some example interview questions. Example answer Content-based recommender systems require knowledge of categorization or traits of the products being recommended to determine product similarity. Col‐ laborative filtering relies on user behavior and user preferences to recommend products that users with similar tastes enjoyed and thus can be more ignorant about the products themselves. Hence, content-based recommenders work well when there are not many users or items to construct the user-item matrix for collaborative filtering. In other words, content-based recommenders can still make recommendations when there is the “cold-start” problem, as long as there is information on the features of the items/products and some information on the traits or preferences of the users, without requiring more data on user behavior and interactions like collab‐ orative filtering does. On the other hand, collaborative filtering is suited for scenarios in which a lot of data on user behavior is available. At times, it can be hard to gather sufficient, meaningful features that describe the products, which makes content-based rec‐ ommender systems ineffective. In these cases, collaborative filtering can be more suitable. Anecdotally, I once worked on a project where a collaborative fil‐ tering algorithm (ALS) worked better for users who had used the web platform for a while but poorly for new users. Using content web platform for a while but poorly for new users. Using contentbased filtering with XGBoost worked better for new users, and we deployed different models depending on what type of user they were. Of course, this is only one example, and it may differ for your case. Example answer The cold-start problem: this is when there aren’t a lot of past data points avail‐ able for an ML model to train on. Therefore, the model won’t be able to learn enough patterns from the past to accurately predict the correct results for new data points. In recommender systems, content-based systems can be used, which require less user-behavior data but do still require sufficient product-feature data. This can help with the cold-start problem and still provide recommenda‐ tions to newer website users. Recommender systems can also encounter challenges with data quality, a prob‐ lem that isn’t exclusive to recommender systems. This can include errors in the source data—for example, due to a bug while ingesting the data. This issue can be addressed by analyzing where the source data has issues and then fixing it with the teams that handle data quality (at times, data engineers or platform engi‐ neers, or the MLEs and data scientists themselves). However, identifying that there is a data quality issue is important in the first place, and some preventative measures include using data quality monitoring tools like Great Expectations to alert the team when there are shifts in the data distribution or many missing val‐ ues, for example. When there are many missing values in an ML dataset, this is called sparsity . For example, users who sign up for a web platform with a questionnaire that asks for user preferences might not input several signup fields correctly or might skip them altogether. As an example, when someone signs up for a new Reddit account, there is a prompt that shows them common subreddits (subforums) that they may be interested in, but the user can skip this step. This is by design to make the web signup as frictionless as possible, but scenarios like this could cause data sparsity when you are trying to build a feature set for a RecSys. Possi‐ ble solutions include imputation (e.g., filling in missing values with the mean or using a tree-based method to fill in the data), using collaborative filtering or matrix factorization techniques, feature engineering, and more. Example answer Explicit feedback includes user ratings or reviews while implicit feedback has to be derived from available user behavior, such as the time spent on a web page or clickstream behavior. The benefits of explicit feedback include a clearly quanti‐ fied rating to use in machine learning as well as clarity when compared to implicit feedback. However, explicit feedback can be harder to gather since not all users will leave a review after every interaction (most don’t). Thus, measuring the user’s engagement or enjoyment via implicit feedback, such as video watch time or time spent reading on a website, might be used. Of course, this can lead to imperfect measures: is the user spending a long time on the web‐ page because they enjoyed the content or because they were confused about the text on it? Overall, it is important to consider the trade-offs, but in practice, you can often combine both feedback signals in your ML models. Example answer This is a common problem facing ML scenarios: there are a few classes or cate‐ gories that have many more observations or data points than others, and there are many classes/categories that have so few observations that they form a long To handle this issue, oversampling techniques may be helpful in simpler cases, such as creating more data points of categories that have fewer observations. However, when there are many classes/categories of observations, simple over‐ sampling techniques won’t be able to alleviate this issue. Additional techniques such as feature engineering and ensemble methods can be used instead, or in conjunction with oversampling. An example of ensemble methods could be cre‐ ating a separate recommender for popular items versus low-engagement items. In companies like Amazon and Spotify, combining RecSys with other families such as reinforcement learning helps ensure that long-tail products, artists, or To loop back to the beginning of this section, recommender systems are a common default ML topic to ask about since many tech companies’ ML use cases can be formulated as a ranking or recommendation problem. In big tech, I’ve seen an increase of combining NLP techniques or RL with RecSys, so be sure to check out the papers in “Resources for Learning About RecSys Algo‐ rithms” on page 95for existing examples of well-known RecSys for existing examples of well-known RecSysfocused products, such as social media (e.g., Facebook, Instagram), entertainment (e.g., Netflix, Spotify, YouTube), online shopping (e.g., Amazon), and more.',\n",

       "   'text': 'In Chapter 1 , you learned about the various steps you will go through as part of your ML interviews. In Chapter 2 , you looked at how to tie your experiences to roles of interest as well as how to craft a relevant resume. The goal of the previous chapters was to get you invited to interviews. In this chapter, I’ll focus on ML algorithms. As you recall, the interview process is illustrated in Figure 1-9 , and the ML algorithms interview is only one portion of the technical interviews; the rest, such as ML training and evaluation, coding, and so on, will be covered in subsequent chapters. You’re likely to be asked ML algorithm technical questions in an interview if you’re applying for any of the following jobs: • Data scientist who builds ML models • Machine learning engineer • Applied scientist • And similar roles Recall that within the common ML job titles ( Figure 1-8 ), there are some jobs that have the responsibility of training ML models in the ML lifecycle. This chapter focu‐ ses on assessing candidates for those skills; if the job you’re aiming for focuses less on training ML models, you might get a simplified version of this type of interview, or it might be skipped completely. This interview is meant to assess your understanding of ML algorithms, especially on the theoretical side. As to how you implement the algorithms with code, I cover that in the model deployment questions in Chapter 6 and the coding/programming tech‐ nical interview in Chapter 5 . The goal for you as an interviewee is for the interviewers to confirm that you understand the underlying concepts behind ML algorithms. Roles do exist where all you have to know is how to import the library with Python, but for more advanced projects, an underlying understanding can help you custom‐ ize various ML approaches and better debug and troubleshoot models. As covered in Chapter 1 , in the three pillars of ML roles, this is the pillar of ML algorithm and data intuition, which showcases your ability to adapt (refer to Figure 1-6 ). This skill is especially important in companies that have complex ML use cases and custom-made solutions, where you might modify or combine various off-the-shelf methods or cre‐ ate something from scratch. I try to mention as many common algorithms as space allows, but there are many more techniques under the sun. Be sure to check out the linked resources to extend your learning and interview preparation! It is also important to note that, in addition to understanding the ML algorithms’ inner workings and underlying statistical methods, you need to successfully commu‐ nicate that understanding to the interviewer. Yes, I know that communication skills have been brought up many times in this book, but they are what help set you apart as a successful candidate. As a rule of thumb, it’s important to be able to explain algorithms and ML concepts at two levels: on a simple “explain like I’m five years old” level and at a deeper, tech‐ nical level, one more appropriate for a college course. A second rule of thumb is to be prepared to answer follow-up questions to these ML algorithm interview questions. This is so the interviewer knows that you didn’t just memorize and then regurgitate the answer, but that you can apply it to various real-life scenarios on the job. In this chapter, I break down technical questions on the following topics so you can easily refer to a specific question if your interview focuses on that topic: • Statistical techniques • Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning • Natural language processing (NLP) • Recommender systems • Reinforcement learning • Computer vision In technical interviews that are very structured, such as the Ama‐ zon data science initial phone screen, they will ask you clearly scoped questions, such as asking for a definition of a particular algorithm. After you answer, they will generally move on without additional follow-up questions. There are companies that mix structured questions with a free-form discussion, where the inter‐ viewer might dig deeper into your answer, and the conversation might branch out from there into your past experiences.',\n",

       "   'text': 'Statistical techniques are used in every data role, and these techniques are the foun‐ dations for ML projects. Hence, in ML interviews, you will most likely have questions that cover this topic. 1 Statistical techniques help build baseline models to compare more costly models and algorithms against or help discover if there is enough mean‐ ingful data in the first place to build ML models. For the purposes of this book, I will be placing the foundational regression tech‐ niques in this section, as well as various techniques for training and improving ML models. In short, these are (1) foundational techniques and (2) methods used during model training, such as training splits, regularization, and so on. These concepts are foundational knowledge for any type of ML algorithms that will be mentioned later as well as foundations for ML interview questions. This section covers the basics of statistical techniques for those who are unsure whether they have sufficient background knowledge in this area. Feel free to skip the subsections if you already have expertise in any of these areas. Regardless of your expertise, I’ve highlighted specific advice for ML interviews in the tip boxes to help you apply your knowledge of each ML area and excel in your interviews. To further supplement your knowledge on statistical and foundational techniques beyond the summaries I’ve provided in this book, I recommend the following resources: • The Elements of Statistical Learning by Trevor Hastie et al. • An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python by Gareth James et al. • Courses on Coursera by DeepLearning.AI and Andrew Ng; this resource is also useful for all following subtopics of ML (I won’t repeatedly link their courses— since they sometimes change and update—in the following sections). • Introduction to Machine Learning Interviews by Chip Huyen has additional questions for overall ML interviews which can be referenced for most sections in this chapter. Refer back to this section for reference material when preparing for interviews. Now, let’s jump in. Here’s an overview of one of the foundations of ML algorithms—variables—and a simple example of fitting a model. Let’s say that you have a dataset about apples, with the weight and height of each apple. You also have a list of past sales prices of each apple. With the list of apple weights, heights, and past sales prices, you want to guess the sales price of new apples, before they are sold. For the sake of this example, ignore big grocery chains automati‐ cally calculating a price, but let’s say you’re selling as a hobby to friends and family, or maybe you’re running a farm that a grandparent left you. So you are making use of the weight and height of each single new apple to predict its price. Weight and height are fixed observations at that point in time (an apple can’t be both 100 grams and 150 grams at the same time). Now, to connect all these concepts, let’s add in some terminology. Variables refer to everything that is being taken into account in your model of how apple prices are cal‐ culated. So the variables in this case include weight, height, and price. Within these variables, you know the weight and height of each new apple, and they are fixed at that point in time. So the weight and height are independent variables. Then, you have another variable, price, that you’d like to predict for new apples prior to know‐ ing the correct answer before selling them. The predicted price depends on the height and weight of the new apple. For example, heavier and taller apples sell for more money. Thus, price is a dependent variable (shown in Table 3-1 ). Table 3-1. Examples of independent and dependent variables The concepts of independent and dependent variables are tried and true, but the ter‐ minology might not be. In different fields, you may have come across the terms listed in Table 3-2 , although they may differ from industry to industry or from textbook to textbook. During your interview, make sure you and the interviewer aren’t crossing wires due to terminology, and double-check with your interviewer if you sense that you’re using a different term to refer to the same thing. Knowing the most common terms can help you use them appropriately in your interviews in various fields. Table 3-2. Synonyms of independent and dependent variables Models are a way of using past data points to describe “the way the world works,” or, in other words, a way of finding patterns and connections with past information. The apples example from the previous section uses a model that describes the way pricing works. The model is something that knows the “truth”—even if it’s not the full truth but rather our best attempt to approximate the truth. Thus, the model can be used to predict our best approximation of future data points. This applies for all “models” in ML models. Recommender-system models seek to predict what a user will like or click on when visiting a website. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition “learn” a model of what various pixels represent: is this cluster and layout of pixels a cat or a dog? Just as for independent and dependent variables, it is important to have a shared defi‐ nition for “model” to prevent miscommunication during an interview, such as con‐ fusing algorithms with models. 2 The model is the outcome of having run and fit an ML algorithm. I wanted to make sure I included regression models. I’m glad that I learned the detailed ins and outs of linear and logistic regression, even calculating them by hand (a requirement for the second-year statistics course I was taking as part of an eco‐ nomics major at university). This knowledge has compounded and helped me under‐ stand the new ML algorithms I’ve encountered as well as how to apply them in practice. All of my learning stemmed from understanding these entry-level concepts, so I highly recommend not shying away from learning the mathematics of regression models. Again, feel free to skip this section if you already have expertise in this area. Let’s use the apple example from an earlier section in a graph. For simplicity and to squeeze it onto a two-dimensional graph, let’s use just one independent variable, weight , to predict the dependent variable, price . Each dot on the graph in Figure 3-1 represents a data point from past sales, so you already know the sale prices for them. For example, the dot with a callout on the graph weighs 80 grams (its intersect on the x-axis) and sold for $1 (its intersect on the y-axis). Note that this is a simple example; most usage of linear regression will have multiple independent variables (“multivaria‐ ble”) and if visualized, will be a line in an N -dimensional space, where N = number of variables + 1 (when there is one output variable). In addition, this example has one dependent variable; when there are multiple dependent/output variables, the regres‐ sion task is referred to as being multivariate . Note that multivariate is separate from the “multivariable” concept mentioned earlier. Figure 3-1. Data points to be used for linear regression. The next step in linear regression is fitting the titular “line” to the data points. Behind the scenes, software tools like Python, Stata, IBM SPSS, SAS, MATLAB, and the like will calculate a “line of best fit.” According to the definition of a model given previ‐ ously in this section, this line is the model , which is the best approximation of the truth with the data points that you have. Starting with an initial line, the software will calculate the residual : the y-axis distance between a data point and the line, as illus‐ trated in Figure 3-2 . Colloquially, the residual is also referred to as the residual error . Figure 3-2. Fitting the line of best fit in linear regression; the line is iterated on until the residuals are as small as possible. All the residuals are squared so that predictions above and the line don’t cancel each other out due to having opposite signs (positive, negative). The goal is that the sum of the residuals is as small as possible since if you have a line that is drastically far away from the data points, that means the line isn’t fitting well to as many data points as possible and as correctly as possible. Mathematically, a common technique to tell how well the line is fitting is the process called least squares . Achieving least squares means finding the line that results in the smallest sum of squared residuals, which in turn means you have the “line of best fit”: the line is fitting the data points with least distance from the data points overall, as shown in Figure 3-3 . Figure 3-3. Least squares and terminology; y represents observed data points, and ŷ (y Figure 3-3. Least squares and terminology; y represents observed data points, and ŷ (yhat) represents the predicted/estimated values. The end result is a line that has the smallest sum of least squares to the data points, as illustrated in Figure 3-4 . Figure 3-4. The resulting line of best fit with least squares from the data in Figure 3-1 . Going forward, you can use this “line of best fit” as a model to predict new apple pri‐ ces! You can plug the apple weight into the line (in equation form) to get a numerical value for the predicted price. This is one of the most basic ways of calculating a model from data points, but it has the same pattern as more in-depth ML models and algo‐ rithms that are covered in the next chapter. Namely, you’ll initialize a line (you don’t know if this is the best model yet) and calculate the residuals, or how well it fits. Next, you’ll change the line by tilting it a little—mathematically, this is called updating coef‐ ficients or weights— and calculate the residuals again, as illustrated in Figure 3-2 . This updating process is called training , which is where the commonly used phrase “training/to train an ML model” comes from. If the sum of the squared residuals is getting smaller, then you are on the right track. When you can’t make the squared residuals any smaller, you’ve achieved least squares, and that’s how you can say the line is your best approximation with this dataset (as illustrated in Figure 3-4 ). It’s like that game where there’s an item hidden in the room, and as you walk around the room trying to find it, your friend says “hot” if you’re getting closer and “cold” when you’re walking farther away. You want to walk toward hotter and hotter areas in the room, until you reach the final position. In Chapter 4 , I’ll walk through ways to evaluate models via error terms such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and more, which are very sim‐ ilar concepts to residuals. The main difference here is that residuals are the difference between past observation data and model estimations while errors are the difference between model estimations and actual data previously unseen by the model. In other words, errors are the differences after applying the model to previously unseen data in order to evaluate model performance. To sum up, when using supervised 3 machine learning such as the simple linear regression example in the previous section, you’ll generally start with a dataset and want the ML algorithm to learn a model of how things work. You then will use the model to calculate the values of dependent variables, such as predicting how much apples will sell for before they are actually sold. In other words, you have a dataset of past data points and, of course, no future data points. When the ML model is being trained, it’s learning to “fit” the data that you currently have. There are some issues that could arise with model training when the model is used in the real world. For one, there will always be outliers or changing events in the real world. One example is in financial predictions with ML: the market could swing suddenly to a bear (downturn) market, and the model we’ve trained with financial data in a bull (upswing) market will produce horrible and wildly inaccurate predictions. Another example is that the dataset you have isn’t representative enough of the behaviors of the real world. In the apples example from the previous section, you assume that with the weight and height data of the apples, you can predict the sell price of new apples. But what if the data you have on hand isn’t enough, and apple variants like Fuji or Honeycrisp (one of my favorites) sell for more? You didn’t have each apple’s variant name tracked in your dataset, so then your model may be incorrect once you put it to the test. But for now, you have only the current dataset. To make the most of it, you need to keep some of the data you have for testing purposes. What this means is that you can break out 80% of the apple data points to use for model training and then save 20% of the apple data points to run the trained model predictions on. The 80% the model is trained on is called the training set (sometimes referred to as the train set ), and the 20% of data that is unseen by the model during the training phase is called the test set . This mimics the real-world scenario of running the model to predict new data points; the test set serves that purpose. In many cases, you might even split the data into three chunks: 80% as the training dataset, 10% as the validation (holdout) dataset, and another 10% as the test dataset ( Figure 3-5 ). The validation set allows you to monitor the model’s performance during the train‐ ing process without “formally” evaluating it, and it enables you to diagnose weak spots of the model and tune its parameters. The test set, as previously mentioned, was unseen by the model during the training process and thus is used to formally evaluate the model performance, mimicking a real-world environment as much as possible. Of course, having a test and validation set isn’t infallible, which brings us to more robust techniques and the concepts of model overfitting and underfitting. Figure 3-5. Training, validation, and test set splits. For interview questions on training and test sets, make sure you can name common ways to augment the simpler splits, such as using cross-validation : 4 splitting up data into smaller chunks and rotating through them as training sets. There are many reasons a model may not perform well on real-world data (or even the validation or test set). A common starting point is addressing overfitting or underfitting. Underfitting is when the model isn’t fitting well. This might mean that the model isn’t able to capture the relationship between the dataset’s independent variables (e.g., weight, height, etc.) and the dependent variables (e.g., price). Conse‐ quently, some ways to reduce underfitting are related to helping the model learn more nuances or patterns during the training process. For example, adding more variables, or model features, such as apple variant or age of the apple, could help the model learn more patterns from the training data and potentially reduce underfitting. A second way to reduce underfitting is to increase the Overfitting is when a model fits the training data too closely and very specifically, perhaps finding patterns that happen to be in the training set but not elsewhere. A simplified example is that the training data just so happens to have a lot of apples that are disproportionately expensive despite their weight (e.g., Sekai Ichi apples 6 ). The model learned from that data and overfit to it, therefore making incorrect predictions that are overpriced for cheaper apple variants. Simply put, the model is overmemo‐ rizing the training data and unable to generalize to new data points. There are many techniques to make the model generalize better, such as adding more training data, data augmentation, or regularization. 7 I’ll cover the details of regularization next. Regularization is a technique used to reduce overfitting of ML models. Generally, regularization will create a damper on model weights/coefficient. By this point, you likely know what I’m going to do—which is to bring up the apples again! Apples are my favorite fruit, which is probably why I use the example so often. So let’s say the model has learned to weigh “weight of apple” more heavily (accidental pun, but model “weights” is legitimate terminology); then the weight of the apple is mathe‐ matically increasing the results of the ML model’s prediction of the price by a rela‐ tively high positive value. If you can dampen the amount by which the weight of the apple increases the model’s predictions of the price, via regularization, that can make the model generalize more and take other variables into account more evenly. The variance bias trade-off is a common topic in ML interviews. When applying ML model improvement techniques such as regularization, it is important to consider the trade-off between fixing for bias versus variance. Bias refers to the overall inaccuracy of the model and can often be caused by an oversimplified (underfit) model. Variance comes from overfitting, when the model has learned too specifically from the training set. One way to remember why this is called “variance” is that the term refers to the variability of the model: the model is overfit to specific points or traits, so the model is very sensitive to different data points, causing fluctuation and variability. Regularization might cause a model to reduce its variance but might inadvertently increase bias, so that’s a reason to be cautious and test various model-improvement techniques. Now that I’ve covered various statistical and ML techniques at a higher level, let’s look at some sample questions. Here, I will dive into the details of common interview questions that stem from the concepts covered in this section. These details may not have been previously addressed, so my hope is that these sample questions also serve to explain the new concepts. Example answer L1 regularization , also known as lasso regularization , 8 is a type of regularization that shrinks model parameters toward zero. L2 regularization (also known as ridge regularization ) adds a penalty term to the objective function that is propor‐ tional to the square of the coefficients of the model. This penalty term shrinks the coefficients toward zero, but unlike L1 (lasso) regularization, it does not make any of the coefficients exactly equal to zero. L2 regularization can help reduce overfitting and improve the stability of the model by keeping coefficients from becoming too large. Both L1 and L2 regulari‐ zation are commonly used to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of ML models. Interview questions on model overfitting and underfitting may lead to follow-up questions. For example, if you bring up L1 and L2 regularization, the interviewer might ask, “What other types of reg‐ ularization could work?” In that case, you could bring up elastic net , which is a combination of L1 and L2 techniques. Or for the overfitting case, ensemble techniques can also help (refer to “Inter‐ view question 3-3: Explain boosting and bagging and what they can help with.” on page 76 ). Example answer Imbalanced datasets in ML refer to datasets in which some classes or categories outweigh others. 9 Techniques to deal with imbalanced datasets include data aug‐ mentation, oversampling, undersampling, ensemble methods, and so on: Data augmentation Data augmentation involves generating more examples for the ML model to train on, such as rotating images so that the dataset includes images of humans turned upside down as well as the normal upright image orienta‐ tion. Without data augmentation, the model might not be able to correctly recognize images of humans who are laying sideways or doing headstands since the data is imbalanced toward humans in an upright pose. Oversampling Oversampling is a technique to increase the number of data points of a minority class via synthetic generation. As an example, SMOTE (synthetic minority oversampling technique) 10 uses the feature vectors of the minority classes to generate synthetic data points that are located between real data points and their k-nearest neighbors. This could synthetically increase the size of the minority class(es) and improve the performance of the ML model trained on a dataset with oversampling treatment. Undersampling Undersampling does the opposite: it reduces examples from the majority class to balance the number of data points of the majority class and minority class(es). Oversampling is generally preferred in practice since undersam‐ pling may cause useful data to be discarded, which is exacerbated when the dataset is already small. Ensemble methods Ensemble methods can also be used to increase model performance when dealing with an imbalanced dataset. 11 Each model in the ensemble can be trained on a different subset of the data and can help learn the nuances of each class better. When answering ML interview questions, take a second to confirm the scope of the question. In other words, if the question is asking only for a definition of logistic regression, don’t go on a tangent about various other techniques. If the question is open-ended, you can confirm whether the interviewer is asking for something specific. Example answer Bagging and boosting are ensemble techniques used to improve the performance of ML models: Bagging Bagging trains multiple models on different subsets of the training data and combines their predictions to make a final prediction. Boosting Boosting trains a series of models where each model tries to correct the mis‐ takes made by the previous model. The final prediction is made by all the models. Ensemble techniques can help with a variety of issues encountered during ML training. For example, they can help with imbalanced data 12 and See Chapter 4 for more in-depth questions concerning model evaluation.',\n",

       "   'text': 'In ML roles, knowing when and what to pick from each family of techniques— including supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning—is an essential skill. In my previous jobs, I’ve used supervised learning to prevent fraud and customer churn, but at other times, I used unsupervised learning like anomaly detection for the same problem, depending on the data and situation. Sometimes (more often, as you grow more senior in your ML career), you might even create an ML pipeline with both supervised and unsupervised learning. In your reinforcement learning pipeline, you might use supervised learning in a previous step to label features. Understanding the underlying mechanics can help you adapt to new situations when using different techniques might be more effective than sticking to what is convenient. Therefore, in interviews there are often questions about supervised versus unsuper‐ vised learning. Reinforcement learning (RL) is considered a somewhat advanced topic and may not be touched on in many interviews. However, I’ve been asked about it in a nontrivial number of interviews because of the growth of RL use for industry applications such as in conjunction with recommender systems—although my past work experience in RL may have prompted the interviewers to ask me about it. As I mentioned in Chapter 2 , if something’s on your resume, it’s fair game to discuss in the interview! For a more comprehensive overview of RL, see “Reinforcement Learn‐ ing Algorithms” on page 101 . Regardless of what types of ML roles you’re interviewing for, knowledge about supervised and unsupervised learning is a must. Brush up on reinforcement learning concepts afterward, in terms of priority. This section covers the basics of labeled data, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi- and self-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning, those who are unsure whether they have the background knowledge in this area. Feel free to skip the subsections if you already have expertise in any of these areas. Regardless of your expertise, I’ve highlighted specific advice for ML interviews in the tip boxes to help you apply your knowledge of each ML area and excel in your interviews. To further supplement your knowledge on supervised and unsupervised ML tech‐ niques, beyond the summaries I’ve provided in this book, I recommend the following resource: • The Elements of Statistical Learning by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jer‐ ome Friedman Refer back to this section for reference material when preparing for interviews. Returning to our apple dataset from “Summarizing Independent and Dependent Variables,” you have the data points for how much apples sold for in the past. The price is also the dependent variable in “Summarizing Linear Regression.” The fact that you do have labels for the dataset 14 means that the ML tasks you were doing pre‐ viously were with labeled data. An example of unlabeled data is when you have the prices and weights of the apples but not the apple variants, yet you try to deduce commonalities within different variants of apples. Because you don’t initially have the correct or expected “label”—in this case, the apple variant—you would be using unla‐ beled data and conducting unsupervised learning. Building on the concept of labeled and unlabeled data, let’s move on to supervised learning. Supervised learning is the first type of machine learning as defined by its use of labeled data, illustrated in Figure 3-6 . Supervised learning uses correct or expected outcomes of the past to predict the dependent variables for new or future data points. The example of using apple weight, variant, and so on to predict sales prices for new apples is supervised learning. Supervised learning can be broken down into two main categories: regression and classification. Figure 3-6. Overview of machine learning families (simplified for understanding). In regression tasks, the dependent/output variable is a continuous value. For example, predicting stock prices, housing prices, or weather (temperature) produces continu‐ ous values. Classification is a type of supervised learning in which the dependent/ output variable is categorical—that is, it is put into a category, such as “it’s a dog” or “it’s a cat.” Classification examples include detecting whether something is or isn’t spam, using image recognition such as tagging animal types in a picture, and so on. It is possible to mix categorical data with continuous data via techniques such asone onehot encoding . For example, if we’re trying to classify if there is a dog or a cat in an image, an image that has a dog will be encoded with 1 for the “dog” category and 0 for the “cat” category. Think of it like a Boolean (True/False) representation of the data for each category. Then you can mix these numerical encodings (0 or 1) with datasets with continuous values. Unsupervised learning is training a model with unlabeled data: when you do not have the “labels” available (the labels being the correct or expected values that you are looking for). You’d likely use unsupervised learning to find patterns, commonalities, or anomalies in the dataset without prior knowledge in the ML model of correct or expected result labels. Common usage of unsupervised learning includes clustering and dimensionality reduction (see Figure 3-6 ). Many generative models are unsupervised, such as varia‐ tional autoencoder (VAE), which is used with applications like Stable Diffusion for image generation. Clustering is an ML task that groups similar data points together into clusters, as illustrated in Figure 3-7 , which allows you to see any emerging patterns. While you won’t be able to deduce any labels that you don’t have, you can still find outliers or clusters of interest to further investigate. Unsupervised learning can be used for cus‐ tomer segmentation because you can hypothesize that customers in the same clusters might have similar preferences or behaviors. You can use unsupervised learning for anomaly and outlier detection since you can find abnormal patterns in the data without prior knowledge of what an “anomaly” looks like. Figure 3-7. Example of unsupervised learning: clustering. Dimensionality reduction is a common technique used to reduce the number of redundant input variables in training data. Reducing the number of features/input variables can help to reduce overfitting since models that learn from too many vari‐ ables might also learn from the “noise” from those variables. Additional variations as extensions of supervised and unsupervised learning have become more popular in the industry, especially because of limitations on fully label‐ ing large amounts of data. You might not encounter these concepts much during interviews, but you should be aware of them. If the team you’re interviewing with uses these techniques, it will be good to be prepared to discuss them. Semisupervised learning uses a small amount of labeled data (usually manually labeled) to train a separate ML model specifically meant to help with machine label‐ ing previously unlabeled data. The initial labeled dataset is then combined with the machine-generated labels with highest confidence to create a larger labeled dataset, as illustrated in Figure 3-8 . Figure 3-8. Semisupervised learning overview. Self-supervised learning 15 relies on the dataset itself to learn latent representations, without labels. For example, in an image, if certain parts are removed, can we predict or generate those missing parts? Common usage of self-supervised learning includes filling in missing parts of images, audio, video, 16 text, and so on. Semisupervised and self-supervised learning can be brought up in interview answers to help with a lack of labeled data or cases where it’s not necessary to label all the data. The third major type of machine learning based on the dataset or the usage of labels is reinforcement learning (RL). In it’s simplest form, RL doesn’t necessarily require a prior dataset, although generally in industry, I’d still prefer to have some existing dataset or existing model so I can test the RL algorithms offline (not live) before deploying the RL agent into the real world or into the hands of customers. RL relies on an “agent,” which is not the same as the concept of an ML “model” that I introduced earlier, although they do have similarities in that they both improve and learn through iterations. RL learns through trial and error. The agent only needs to react to each new data point as it comes in, and the agent eventually learns enough from experience to figure out an optimal way of predicting the best action to carry out next. A common RL example is a robot learning to navigate a maze that has rewards, traps, and an exit (for an example, see Figure 3-14 later in this chapter). The first time the robot moves through the maze, it has no knowledge of where the gold, traps, and exit are. But as it encounters those things in the environment, it also acquires knowledge, or data points, about the past, similar to constructing its own dataset via trial and error. After the robot has navigated the maze enough times, it learns the fastest and safest path to the exit. But based on how you design the RL agent, it can also optimize for various goals, such as collecting the most gold instead of reaching the exit as fast as possible. There are various types of RL, some of which resemble supervised learning, but I will leave the in-depth discussion of those for the section “Reinforcement Learning Algo‐ rithms” on page 101 . RL is commonly used in gaming, robotics, and self-driving cars, but RL can also be used for a growing number of applications that previously used supervised learning, such as a system that recommends videos on YouTube. Now that I’ve covered supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning at a higher level, let’s look at some common interview questions that stem from these concepts. This section specifically covers interview questions on supervised and unsupervised learning; since RL has its own section, “Rein‐ forcement Learning Algorithms” on page 101 , the questions on RL can be found there. Example answer The regression family of algorithms includes linear regression and logistic regres‐ sion, among other algorithms such as generalized linear models (GLMs) and var‐ ious time-series regression models such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). The decision tree family of algorithms can be used for both classification and regression tasks within supervised learning; these include XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and so on. Decision trees can be combined in random forest algo‐ rithms, which ensemble (combine) a multitude of decision trees. Like decision trees, random forests can be used for both classification and regression tasks under supervised learning. Neural networks can be used for supervised learning tasks as well as unsupervised learning. In terms of supervised learning, these include many tasks in this sec‐ tion, such as image classification, object detection, speech recognition, and natu‐ ral language processing (NLP). Other algorithms include naive Bayes, 17 which is a supervised classification algorithm that uses Bayes’ theorem . 18 Applications of Bayes’ theorem in ML include Bayesian neural networks, 19 which predict a distribution of results (for example, a normal model might predict the price is $100, but the Bayesian model will predict the price is $100 with a standard deviation of 5). Example answer Unsupervised learning is commonly used for clustering, anomaly detection, and dimensionality reduction. I’ll group the algorithms by those categories. Cluster‐ ing is often done with algorithms such as k-means clustering and density-based clustering (DBSCAN algorithm). K-means clustering groups the data into k clusters, and the algorithm iteratively labels each data point with the cluster’s centroid. The cluster centroid is then updated, and the algorithm continues until the cluster assignments have reached a stable state and no longer shift or change. DBSCAN is a popular algorithm that groups together data points that are close to one another (high density) and also separates those clusters from one another depending on their distance. Because unsupervised learning algorithms can han‐ dle large class imbalances, there are common unsupervised learning algorithms that address anomaly detections. There are many algorithms that can be used for dimensionality reduction. Princi‐ pal component analysis (PCA) can “flatten” datasets into a lower-dimensional space. This is useful for data preprocessing since it can reduce the number of redundant features that are used while keeping the variance in the data so that enough signals and patterns are preserved in the data. Autoencoders are a type of unsupervised learning with a broad range of applica‐ tions, notably in NLP—but not limited to NLP. They can be used to encode a compressed representation of input text, which is also a form of dimensionality reduction, and then decode the compressed representation for the generation of the next chunk of text data. This is useful for text completion and text summari‐ zation tasks. As a subset of unsupervised learning, self-supervised learning is also a case where autoencoders can be used. Examples include self-supervised learn‐ Example answer The major difference between the two types of machine learning is related to the training data that is used. Supervised learning uses labeled data while unsuper‐ vised learning uses unlabeled data. Labeled data refers to the correct output or result from the ML model already being inside the training dataset. Supervised and unsupervised learning also differ in terms of the ML model out‐ puts. In supervised learning, the ML model aims to predict what the label would be. Unsupervised learning doesn’t predict specific label(s) but rather tries to find latent patterns and groupings within the dataset, which can be used to cluster new data points. In terms of evaluation, the two types of ML are assessed differently. Supervised learning is evaluated by comparing its outputs with the correct output (with the test/holdout/validation datasets). In unsupervised learning, the model is evalu‐ ated based on how well it groups or captures patterns within the data, via metrics such as the Jaccard score or silhouette index for clustering and receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC)/area under the curve (AUC) metrics for positive rate Finally, supervised learning and unsupervised learning are generally used for different types of tasks. Supervised learning is often used for classification (pre‐ dicting the correct category) or regression (predicting the correct value) tasks while unsupervised learning is often used for clustering, anomaly detection, and dimensionality reduction tasks. Example answer Unsupervised learning and supervised learning differ in the usage of results or labels. Hence, unsupervised learning is most suitable for cases where labeled data is not available or when the task isn’t to predict a “correct” output, but rather to find patterns or anomalies in the data. As a real-world example, supervised learning can be used for classification and object detection, such as in image recognition tasks. In the training dataset I’ll have the correct objects labeled, and the algorithms will then know if they’re learning to detect objects correctly based on comparing their predictions with the ground truth. In other words, if the algorithm isn’t correctly boxing faces in images, I’d know since I’ll have each image (with the faces correctly boxed) to compare to. Other scenarios for supervised learning could include predicting the price of a rare trading card based on its features, such as its age, its series name, and the condition of the card. Given that I have a dataset with fraudulent data already correctly labeled, fraud detection could also be an application of super‐ vised learning. If I didn’t already have labeled data about fraudulent behavior, I might opt to use unsupervised learning instead, via detecting anomalous behaviors. In a real interview, you might not have to come up with so many examples, but as a reference answer, I’m including a few. It’s even better if you can come up with an example that’s a common con‐ cern for the industry of the company where you’re interviewing. For example, time-series examples are often relevant to finance and fintech industries, and fraud detection is relevant to online sales platforms, banking, and finance. Sometimes unsupervised learning is more suitable than supervised learning. For gen‐ eral warning signs of abnormal behavior, anomaly detection can be used to find an anomalous login location for a user’s online bank account. Clustering is an unsuper‐ vised learning task, and a real-world application could be to group customers into segments based on their features (e.g., behavior, preferences), something that busi‐ nesses might use to identify how they can tailor products to users in a cluster or to target marketing campaigns. If I investigate a cluster and it shows that young professionals have similar behaviors via the clustering algorithm, then we might know that we can give them similar promotional materials in the company’s next dig‐ ital ad campaign. Example answer One common problem that can affect supervised learning is the lack of labeled data. For example, when I want to classify specific cartoon and anime characters in images with ML, I don’t have labeled data available on the internet to down‐ load and use. There are open source datasets such as CIFAR, 22 which are labeled for general objects and items, but when it comes to more specific use cases, I would have to acquire and label images myself (for personal usage). I had to address the issue of not having enough labeled data; in this case, hand labeling a few examples worked as a starting point. However, there still weren’t enough labeled examples, which resulted in an imbalanced dataset. To artificially increase the amount of labeled data, I used data augmentation, creating synthetic data and variations on existing data to make the ML model more robust. An example of data augmentation in image recognition is to randomly flip or rotate images. To illustrate why this can increase samples, if I flip one upright anime character looking to the right, it becomes two data points for the model to learn from: one looking right and one looking left. Rotation can also help: can the ML algorithm correctly identify anime characters who are leaning sideways or who are even upside down, doing a headstand? Another tip is to tie techniques that you’ve used to your past experience (so you can answer the interviewer’s follow-up questions more easily) or to scenarios that you know would be relevant to the employer’s industry, as mentioned before.',\n",

       "   'text': 'NLP has gained traction in recent years, with the notable example of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. There are a lot of interview questions that build off the foundational tech‐ niques of transformers, and subsequently the BERT and GPT families of models, so I will cover those concepts in this section. NLP is often applied in chatbots and sentiment analysis (for example, to see if the general attitude toward a product or company is positive or negative, based on Reddit or Twitter posts) as well as to generate written content. If you are interviewing for a company or team that is working on NLP, you will definitely be asked to demon‐ strate your understanding of these concepts in depth. Even if you’re not interviewing for an NLP team specifically, I’d still recommend having a general understanding of NLP applications, which will make you a more well-rounded candidate and ML pro‐ fessional. Not to mention, NLP techniques are no longer used to generate written content only; they are also being combined with computer vision, text-to-image models to generate images, video, audio, and so on. Even time-series prediction and recommender systems have started picking up NLP techniques. You’ll benefit from learning the basics of NLP because of how generalizable the techniques are. This section covers the basics of NLP techniques for those who are unsure whether they have the background knowledge in this area. Feel free to skip the subsections if you already have expertise in any of these areas. Regardless of your expertise, I’ve highlighted specific advice for ML interviews in the tip boxes to help you apply your knowledge of each ML area and excel in your interviews. To further supplement your knowledge of NLP techniques beyond the summaries I’ve provided in this book, I recommend the following resources: • Generative Deep Learning by David Foster (O’Reilly) • Natural Language Processing with Transformers by Lewis Tunstall, Leandro von Werra, and Thomas Wolf (O’Reilly) • The Practical Guides for Large Language Models on GitHub • Practical Natural Language Processing by Sowmya Vajjala, Bodhisattwa Majumder, Anuj Gupta, and Harshit Surana (O’Reilly) Refer back to this section for reference material when preparing for interviews. Let’s break down the components that power NLP. First, you have a dataset, often called a text corpus . 23 A text corpus can consist of many types of text, such as news, online forums, or anything with a lot of authentic and meaningful text that isn’t gibberish. Next, with this dataset you’ll need to preprocess the data much like you would for other ML jobs. Some common techniques that are quizzed about in inter‐ views are tokenization, bag of words, or TF-IDF (term frequency–inverse document frequency). Tokenization is the process of breaking down the text into individual words, phrases, or useful semantic units. 24 For example, depending on the situation, the word “pre‐ process” could be left as its own token or separated into “pre” and “process.” “Aren’t” could be left as its own token but could also be separated into “are,” and “n’t.” Once the dataset has been preprocessed, language modeling can be formulated to predict the next sequence of items, which could be the next word (as illustrated in Figure 3-9 ), the next sentence, the next paragraph, missing words, and so on. Figure 3-9. Next word or phrase prediction, as seen in autocomplete on phones or Bag of words ( BoW ) is a way to map a sentence or phrase by mapping the words in it to a vector. The vector can consist of the words and other info, such as how many times the word has appeared (1 if once, 2 if twice, and so on). An example .json representation for the sentence “Syd likes to drink bubble tea and chamomile tea” would be: Note that the word “tea” appears twice, and thus the count is 2. TF-IDF uses the frequency of the appearance of words in a passage or document to determine how relevant those words are. Although it shares many foundational concepts with other types of ML, NLP comes with unique challenges. In cases where supervised learning is used, such as down‐ stream fine-tuning, the data is hard to label. For example, if you are using supervised fine-tuning for sentiment analysis to quickly predict if a user review is positive or negative, it can be ambiguous at times. Another challenge is that there’s a large amount of variability, such as slang and regional syntax differences, which can also lead to data sparsity, where exact combinations of words might rarely appear in the text corpus but are still valid. Common use cases of NLP include sentiment analysis, chatbots, text classification (e.g., spam versus not spam), text generation, text summarization, text-to-image gen‐ eration, and many more. BoW and TF-IDF are useful underlying techniques that I’ve recently heard mentioned in interviews. Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network designed to handle long sequences of data, which is useful in NLP applications. Like attention units in transformers, long-term dependencies and context of prior text are important for NLP to be effective. However, LSTMs have some limitations, such as when dealing with very long sequences of text—that is, understanding the context of text that came much earlier in a page or paragraph. To that end, transformers (cov‐ ered in the next section) are able to handle long-term dependencies better. LSTMs can be used for feature engineering and time series as well. I don’t include more explanation here because of space constraints, but I encourage you to read more. Christopher Olah’s blog Under‐ standing LSTM Networks offers a good series of illustrations for understanding how LSTMs are used. The transformer model was introduced by Google in 2017, 26 which has enabled a larger scope of language models in recent years. Transformers are effective at NLP modeling because of their improvements in handling context and meaning over longer text strings compared to existing architectures like convolutional neural net‐ works (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). 27 Transformers are also better suited to finding patterns within the dataset, as opposed to requiring large, labeled datasets like CNNs and RNNs do. Hence, there is a lower barrier to entry for what datasets are available. With transformers, large, free-form text corpora from the internet became available for use, without the need for costly labeling beforehand. Attention units within the transformer network are part of transformers’ effective‐ ness and can find both short- and long-distance relationships between words, which helps the model correctly label the context. Take, for example, the sentences “Max went to the record store. Later, he bought a Jay Chou album.” Self-attention units can correctly identify that “ he ” is referring to “Max.” Combined with BERT’s encoder architecture and multihead attention mechanisms, this has resulted in significant improvements in the performance and capabilities of NLP tasks. Developed by Google, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Trans‐ formers) models have been used to process queries on the Google search engine since 2019. 28 As hinted at in its full name, BERT makes use of the transformer neutral net‐ work discussed earlier. BERT is pretrained, meaning the initial training step done by Google generates the model that users can access 29 via “self-supervised” learning on a large corpus of text, such as Wikipedia and other text datasets. There are two tasks BERT is trained on during pretraining: masked language modeling (MLM) and next sentence prediction (NSP). Masked language modeling refers to randomly “masking,” or blocking/removing, sev‐ eral tokens in a sentence and letting the model learn to correctly predict those tokens—for example, “Lisa is singing a [MASK],” where [MASK] signifies the token for BERT to predict. This is illustrated in Figure 3-10 . If BERT can predict that “song” or “melody” or other words have a higher probability of being correct, then the model training is going well. If it’s predicting words or tokens like “dog,” then it is not being accurate at that point during model training. Figure 3-10. Illustration of masked language modeling. Next sentence prediction is the second task that BERT is trained on. The goal is to accurately predict the next sentence in a text sequence. Since this training process can provide feedback to the model without external labeling, it is not “supervised” learning per se, but it is described as “self-supervised” since the feedback comes from the text corpus itself. After model pretraining, users can then download the model or use an API 30 to “fine-tune” the model to their own use cases. This improves on the user’s copy of the BERT model and requires supervised learning. For example, the user may wish to use BERT for sentiment analysis; in that case, the user would need to provide examples and labels of text that have a positive sentiment, negative sentiment, or ambiguous sentiment (if the user wishes). If you want to use BERT to generate text with a spe‐ cific tone—for example, a movie supervillain—you’d need to provide BERT-specific examples as part of fine-tuning. BERT saves the user a lot of time on tasks like these since it already has a general understanding of the target language (English, among pretrained models of other languages that have been created by various developers 31 ). Fine-tuning can be used for many other ML models, not just BERT. For example, you can fine-tune models such as GPT-3.5 (at the time of writing). However, I include fine-tuning under BERT since I have seen many interviews ask about fine-tuning in the con‐ text of BERT. The GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) family of NLP models is known for powering the OpenAI tool, ChatGPT. The GPT family of models includes GPT-1, GPT-2, GPT-3, and GPT-4 at the time of writing. 32 They are trained on large corpora of text, 33 such as BookCorpus, WebText (Reddit), English Wikipedia, and more. The GPT family leverages transformers and is pretrained on predicting the next word. Like other major NLP models, it can be fine-tuned 34 downstream to update the pretrained model’s parameters to parameters targeted toward more specific tasks, such as text generation. Notably, GPT-3 (with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 powering ChatGPT at the time of writing) also uses RL via user feedback to improve its model predictions. RL is covered in more detail in “Reinforcement Learning Algorithms” on page 101 . Apart from GPT, several other large language models (LLMs), such as PaLM2 (which powers Google Bard), Llama/ Llama 2 (Meta AI), and more 35 are trained on similar techniques. NLP has been growing at a fast pace, with many well-known LLMs being released in recent years (as illustrated in Figure 3-11 ). I encourage candidates interested in the field to learn more about these models and techniques. I remember exploring Word2vec 36 and GloVe 37 at work, and now there are so many other ways to develop NLP applications. Many foundational methods such as those two and models like BERT are still commonly used, and hiring managers I know still ask about them, so don’t neglect the foundations either! Figure 3-11. Evolutionary tree illustration of large language models; used with permis‐ sion from “The Practical Guides for Large Language Models” . Now that I’ve covered some foundational techniques used in NLP, it’s time to look at some interview questions. The NLP space and applications in generative AI have been moving very quickly, so we’ll see how things change! However, from speaking to hiring managers in my network, I know that all of them still expect knowledge on foundational topics and data preprocessing techniques for NLP use cases. Example answer BERT and other NLP models that have been pretrained can be fine-tuned. A large source of pretrained NLP models is the Hugging Face model repository. Pretrained models may include user-uploaded fine-tuned models of original models by Google, OpenAI, and so on, but users can also download models fine models by Google, OpenAI, and so on, but users can also download models finetuned on tasks like sentiment analysis. If I wanted to fine-tune one of the original models myself, I’d need to provide a labeled dataset for the NLP model. For example, for sentiment analysis, that would include examples of both positive and negative sentiment text; for chat‐ bots, I might provide labeled data with the correct corresponding answer to a help desk question; and for named entity recognition, I’d provide examples of the named entities that I’d expect the NLP model to correctly output. Example answer When starting from a raw corpus, a quick first step is to use regex (regular expression) techniques to clean up unwanted characters. Some downstream tasks don’t rely much on punctuation, but tasks like sentiment analysis could benefit from keeping punctuation; we can see how “!” could be useful for sentiment analysis. Next, we can use tokenization to break the text down into meaningful units, which often happen to be words; for example, “Susan is writing a sentence” becomes the five tokens: “Susan, is, writing, a, sentence.” Stemming and lemmatization both aim to reduce a word to its base form so that tense variations and derivations can still point to the same root word. Stemming is a rough heuristic that removes the ends of words (such as cars → car; history → histori and historical → histori). 38 Stemming is a cruder technique than lem‐ matization , which makes use of the dictionary forms of a base word; for example, in lemmatization, “studying,” “studies,” and “study” will all be lemmatized as “study.” This is useful for the NLP model to recognize that these words mean the same at their root. Example answer Possible challenges with NLP, even with robust pretrained models, could be homonyms/synonyms, sarcasm, or domain-specific language such as that of financial or legal documents and the like. All of these can be improved upon with better downstream fine-tuning with more data that targets the specific case. For example, you can provide more examples of the usage of synonyms so that the NLP model can pick out more signals on when to use which word. There are also inherent biases in many cases; pretraining corpora that are com‐ monly used for LLM training, such as Wikipedia, have a disproportionate number of male volunteer editors. Reddit, being a forum with a large text dataset, is also commonly used as a base for a training dataset and has a disproportionate number of male users. Laura Weidinger et. al (Google DeepMind and collaborators) have published a paper on ethical and social risks of harm from language models that discusses perpetuation It’s important to read through considerations like these; especially in interviews cov‐ ering language models or data acquisition (see Meta’s system design interview in Chapter 6 ), candidates being knowledgeable and thoughtful about potential risks (including biases) is important to succeeding at interviews. Example answer BERT-uncased has a tokenizer that will lowercase text input, so regardless of passing in cased (including uppercase) or all lowercase (uncased) text, it will be the same for BERT-uncased. BERT-cased , however, has a separate entry for the same words with different cases; for example, “The” will be different from “the” in BERT-cased. Thus, BERT-cased has the ability to distinguish between differ‐ ent semantics based on case. In applications where the case information doesn’t matter much, then BERT-uncased may be suitable. However, for situations where cased information is important, such as where proper nouns are valuable for the NLP task, BERT-cased will be preferred. You can see a trend in these questions: regardless of the NLP appli‐ cation (even if it’s generative AI!) knowing how to adapt to situa‐ tions is essential. Preprocessing will be different if proper nouns are useful (don’t lowercase everything), and while sometimes you might keep the punctuation (such as in sentiment analysis), some‐ times you don’t. Deeply understanding NLP techniques can help you respond much better in interviews than if you only memorize and regurgitate.',\n",

       "   'text': 'Recommender systems (RecSys) are everywhere in our digital lives and are responsible for personalization of the web pages and apps you visit, such as Netflix, YouTube, Spotify, any social media site, and much more. One way to tell if a site has personali‐ zation is by comparing the order of items or products shown on its front page or search results when two different people are logged in. For example, what is shown on your YouTube front page is likely not the same as the front page of a sibling or friend. A recommender system recommends items or products that it thinks you might enjoy, interact with, or purchase based on your past behavior. For example, Netflix uses information on what shows and movies you’ve watched before as signals in its recommender systems to suggest new shows and movies for you. Since so many tech products use recommender systems, this is a common “default” category that interviewers at big tech companies will ask about. This section covers the basics of recommender systems techniques for those who are unsure whether they have the background knowledge in this area. Feel free to skip the subsections if you already have expertise in any of these areas. Regardless of your expertise, I’ve highlighted specific advice for ML interviews in the tip boxes to help you apply your knowledge of each ML area and excel in your interviews. To further supplement your knowledge on recommender techniques beyond the summaries I’ve provided in this book, I recommend the following resources: • Practical Recommender Systems by Kim Falk (Manning) • Use cases and papers via Eugene Yan’s curated applied ML repository Refer back to this section for reference material when preparing for interviews. Collaborative filtering is a common technique in recommender systems. The term comes from using data on preferences of many users and/or items (collaborative) to make recommendations for a singular user (filtering). This is based on an assumption that individuals with similar past preferences can share preferences for new, unseen products; hence, the algorithm will recommend new items liked by simi‐ lar users. There are two main types of collaborative filtering techniques: user based and item based. User-based collaborative filtering identifies users with similar interests and preferences and then recommends products or items to each of those similar users that they haven’t seen before. “Similar” users are calculated by ML algorithms, such as matrix factorization, which will be covered later in this chapter. Item-based collab‐ orative filtering identifies items that are similar to one another based on their user ratings or user interaction. Items are then recommended by the collaborative filtering algorithm if a user has previously enjoyed similar items. In user-based and item-based collaborative filtering, you generally need to know users’ ratings and preferences. If a user has left a good rating and review, then you can explicitly know that they enjoy a product. But users simply don’t have enough time to provide explicit, detailed feedback on everything—think about the times you’ve left a review; you likely didn’t do so for every single item you’ve used in the past. However, you can still calculate implicit feedback, such as the time spent on a YouTube video: if someone watches to the end, it could mean the viewer liked it more than a video they closed after two seconds. Using implicit feedback within a recommender system can help alleviate some common biases as well; people are more likely to leave an explicit review if they either loved or hated the product (and you know people are more vocal if something went wrong). In Chapter 4 , I’ll discuss model training and data preprocessing. For recommender systems applications, making sense of the avail‐ able explicit and implicit ratings during exploratory data analysis, model training, data preprocessing, featuring engineering, evalua‐ tion, and monitoring is important to discuss in interviews. Another common type of recommender system is the content-based system. In a content-based recommender system, you need detailed information about the prod‐ ucts themselves. This information could include traits of text descriptions (book blurbs, movie genres and descriptions), images (product screenshots), audio/video (trailers, product videos), and so on to create an understanding of which items are similar to one another. In contrast, the user- and item-based collaborative filtering described earlier relies on user preferences of items or products but not the traits of the items themselves. An example content-based movie recommender system could recommend movies based on the genre, director, or actors of movies that the user has previously watched and enjoyed, as measured by explicit and implicit feedback. Hence, a content-based recommender systems can be formulated as a ranking or classification problem, and algorithms like tree-based models are suitable. There are some pros and cons to using user-based/item-based or content-based rec‐ ommender systems. User-based systems don’t perform as well with new users; this is commonly referred to as the “cold-start” problem since there isn’t enough data on the users’ preferences because they may not have bought or rated any products yet. Content-based recommender systems might need less user-behavior data since they do not rely on other users’ preferences or ratings, which makes them suitable for newer users or niche items with less user feedback overall. But content-based systems might be limited to recommending items similar to what the user has interacted with before; therefore, new items are not introduced to the user, limiting the diversity of the products or items that the user might have enjoyed had they been recommended those products. Knowing the trade-offs between user-based, item-based, and content-based recommender systems can help you in interviews as well as on the job. In reality, explicit feedback can be hard to come by, and implicit feedback might not be perfect. Knowing how to mix and match all the data and RecSys algorithms at your disposal will help you stand out by a lot. Matrix factorization is a technique used in collaborative filtering. First, a matrix is constructed with users as the rows and items as the columns, with the ratings or pref‐ erences of a user on an item as the cell values. This is called the user-item matrix , as illustrated in Figure 3-12 . Since not all users interact with all items, the original matrix will be very sparse. For example, a user might have interacted with only a handful of items, but the online platform has thousands or millions of products. The goal of matrix factorization is to predict those empty values in the matrix—that is, how much a user would rate the items they haven’t interacted with before—and recommend those that you estimate that the user would enjoy. Figure 3-12. Illustration of matrix factorization; source: Google . A classic algorithm is singular value decomposition (SVD); however, I have never seen it used outside of practice datasets because of its expensive computational requirements. 40 For industry applications, if as an ML practitioner you choose to use matrix factorization, the chosen algorithm needs to be able to handle very sparse and large matrices since many online platforms have a large number of products and users. Algorithms such as ALS help address this issue since they use approximation via least squares (covered in “Summarizing Linear Regression” on page 68 ) to calcu‐ late their best guesses for the missing matrix values (how much a user might enjoy an item) instead of the complex matrix manipulations that traditional SVD uses. Now that I’ve covered the basics of recommender systems, let’s go through some example interview questions. Example answer Content-based recommender systems require knowledge of categorization or traits of the products being recommended to determine product similarity. Col‐ laborative filtering relies on user behavior and user preferences to recommend products that users with similar tastes enjoyed and thus can be more ignorant about the products themselves. Hence, content-based recommenders work well when there are not many users or items to construct the user-item matrix for collaborative filtering. In other words, content-based recommenders can still make recommendations when there is the “cold-start” problem, as long as there is information on the features of the items/products and some information on the traits or preferences of the users, without requiring more data on user behavior and interactions like collab‐ orative filtering does. On the other hand, collaborative filtering is suited for scenarios in which a lot of data on user behavior is available. At times, it can be hard to gather sufficient, meaningful features that describe the products, which makes content-based rec‐ ommender systems ineffective. In these cases, collaborative filtering can be more suitable. Anecdotally, I once worked on a project where a collaborative fil‐ tering algorithm (ALS) worked better for users who had used the web platform for a while but poorly for new users. Using content web platform for a while but poorly for new users. Using contentbased filtering with XGBoost worked better for new users, and we deployed different models depending on what type of user they were. Of course, this is only one example, and it may differ for your case. Example answer The cold-start problem: this is when there aren’t a lot of past data points avail‐ able for an ML model to train on. Therefore, the model won’t be able to learn enough patterns from the past to accurately predict the correct results for new data points. In recommender systems, content-based systems can be used, which require less user-behavior data but do still require sufficient product-feature data. This can help with the cold-start problem and still provide recommenda‐ tions to newer website users. Recommender systems can also encounter challenges with data quality, a prob‐ lem that isn’t exclusive to recommender systems. This can include errors in the source data—for example, due to a bug while ingesting the data. This issue can be addressed by analyzing where the source data has issues and then fixing it with the teams that handle data quality (at times, data engineers or platform engi‐ neers, or the MLEs and data scientists themselves). However, identifying that there is a data quality issue is important in the first place, and some preventative measures include using data quality monitoring tools like Great Expectations to alert the team when there are shifts in the data distribution or many missing val‐ ues, for example. When there are many missing values in an ML dataset, this is called sparsity . For example, users who sign up for a web platform with a questionnaire that asks for user preferences might not input several signup fields correctly or might skip them altogether. As an example, when someone signs up for a new Reddit account, there is a prompt that shows them common subreddits (subforums) that they may be interested in, but the user can skip this step. This is by design to make the web signup as frictionless as possible, but scenarios like this could cause data sparsity when you are trying to build a feature set for a RecSys. Possi‐ ble solutions include imputation (e.g., filling in missing values with the mean or using a tree-based method to fill in the data), using collaborative filtering or matrix factorization techniques, feature engineering, and more. Example answer Explicit feedback includes user ratings or reviews while implicit feedback has to be derived from available user behavior, such as the time spent on a web page or clickstream behavior. The benefits of explicit feedback include a clearly quanti‐ fied rating to use in machine learning as well as clarity when compared to implicit feedback. However, explicit feedback can be harder to gather since not all users will leave a review after every interaction (most don’t). Thus, measuring the user’s engagement or enjoyment via implicit feedback, such as video watch time or time spent reading on a website, might be used. Of course, this can lead to imperfect measures: is the user spending a long time on the web‐ page because they enjoyed the content or because they were confused about the text on it? Overall, it is important to consider the trade-offs, but in practice, you can often combine both feedback signals in your ML models. Example answer This is a common problem facing ML scenarios: there are a few classes or cate‐ gories that have many more observations or data points than others, and there are many classes/categories that have so few observations that they form a long To handle this issue, oversampling techniques may be helpful in simpler cases, such as creating more data points of categories that have fewer observations. However, when there are many classes/categories of observations, simple over‐ sampling techniques won’t be able to alleviate this issue. Additional techniques such as feature engineering and ensemble methods can be used instead, or in conjunction with oversampling. An example of ensemble methods could be cre‐ ating a separate recommender for popular items versus low-engagement items. In companies like Amazon and Spotify, combining RecSys with other families such as reinforcement learning helps ensure that long-tail products, artists, or To loop back to the beginning of this section, recommender systems are a common default ML topic to ask about since many tech companies’ ML use cases can be formulated as a ranking or recommendation problem. In big tech, I’ve seen an increase of combining NLP techniques or RL with RecSys, so be sure to check out the papers in “Resources for Learning About RecSys Algo‐ rithms” on page 95for existing examples of well-known RecSys for existing examples of well-known RecSysfocused products, such as social media (e.g., Facebook, Instagram), entertainment (e.g., Netflix, Spotify, YouTube), online shopping (e.g., Amazon), and more.',\n",
