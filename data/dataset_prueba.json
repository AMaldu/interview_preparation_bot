I’ll also clarify the responsibilities of various job titles, such as data scientist, machine learning engineer, and so on, as this is a common point of confusion for job seekers. These will be illustrated with an ML skills matrix and ML lifecycle that will be referenced throughout the book. The second part of this chapter walks through the interview process, from beginning to end. I’ve mentored candidates who appreciated this overview since online resources often focus on specific pieces of the interview but not how they all connect together and result in an offer. Especially for new graduates  and readers coming from different industries, this chapter helps get everyone on the same page as well as clarifies the process. The interconnecting pieces of interviews are complex, with many types of combina‐ tions depending on the ML role you’re aiming for. This overview will help set the stage, so you’ll know what to focus your time on. For example, some online resources focus on knowledge specific to “product data scientists,” but will title the course or article “data scientist interview tips” without differentiating. For a newcomer, it’s hard to tell if that is relevant to your own career interests. After this chapter, you’ll be able to tell what skills are required for each job title, and in  Chapter 2 , you’ll be able"

Overview of the chapters and how they tie into the ML interview process. Depending on where you are in your ML interview journey, I encourage you to focus on the chapters and sections that seem relevant to you. I’ve also planned the book to be referenced as you go along; for example, you might iterate on your resume multi‐ ple times and then flip back to  Chapter 2  when needed. The same applies to the other chapters. With that overview, let’s continue."

        "text": "First, let’s walk through a brief history of job titles. I decided to start with this section to dispel some myths about the “data scientist” job title and shed some light on why there are so many ML-related job titles. After understanding this history, you should be more aware of what job titles to aim for yourself. If you’ve ever been confused about the litany of titles such as machine learning engineer (MLE), product data sci‐ entist, MLOps engineer, and more, this section is for you. ML techniques aren’t a new thing; in 1985, David Ackley, Geoffrey E. Hinton, and Terrence J. Sejnowski popularized the Boltzmann Machine algorithm.  Even before that, regression techniques  had early developments in the 1800s. There have long been jobs and roles that use modeling techniques to forecast and predict. Econome‐ tricians, statisticians, financial modelers, physics modelers, and biochemical modelers have existed as professions for decades. The main difference is that there were much smaller datasets compared to the modern day (barring simulations). It was only in recent years, just before the 21st century, when compute power started to increase exponentially. In addition, advances in distributed and parallel computing created a cycle in which “big data” became more readily available. This allowed practitioners to apply that advanced compute power to millions or billions of data points. Larger datasets started being accumulated and distributed for ML research, such as WordNet,  and, subsequently, ImageNet,  a project led by Fei-Fei Li. These collective"
