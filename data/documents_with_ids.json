    "text": "In the first part of this chapter, I\u2019ll walk through the structure of this book. Then, I\u2019ll discuss the various job titles and roles that use ML skills in industry. 1 I\u2019ll also clarify the responsibilities of various job titles, such as data scientist, machine learning engineer, and so on, as this is a common point of confusion for job seekers. These will be illustrated with an ML skills matrix and ML lifecycle that will be referenced throughout the book. The second part of this chapter walks through the interview process, from beginning to end. I\u2019ve mentored candidates who appreciated this overview since online resources often focus on specific pieces of the interview but not how they all connect together and result in an offer. Especially for new graduates 2 and readers coming from different industries, this chapter helps get everyone on the same page as well as clarifies the process. The interconnecting pieces of interviews are complex, with many types of combina\u2010 tions depending on the ML role you\u2019re aiming for. This overview will help set the stage, so you\u2019ll know what to focus your time on. For example, some online resources focus on knowledge specific to \u201cproduct data scientists,\u201d but will title the course or article \u201cdata scientist interview tips\u201d without differentiating. For a newcomer, it\u2019s hard to tell if that is relevant to your own career interests. After this chapter, you\u2019ll be able to tell what skills are required for each job title, and in Chapter 2 , you\u2019ll be able to parse out that information yourself from job postings and make your resume as relevant to the job title and job posting as possible.",

The same applies to the other chapters. With that overview, let\u2019s continue. The companion site to this book, https://susanshu.substack.com , features bonus content, helper resources, and more.",
